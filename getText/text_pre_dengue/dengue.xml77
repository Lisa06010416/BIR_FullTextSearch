Vector competence analysis of two Aedes aegypti lineages from Bello, Colombia, reveals that they are affected similarly by dengue-2 virus infection.
Dengue is the second most prevalent vector-borne disease after malaria in Colombia. It is caused by dengue virus, an arbovirus that exhibits high epidemic power, which is evidenced by its occurrence in more than 80% of the country, largely because of the extensive dispersion of the mosquito vector Aedes aegypti. The existence of two lineages of Ae. aegypti has been proposed based on genetic differences at the mitochondrial level, and they have been reported to circulate in similar proportions in the municipality of Bello (Colombia). It has been suggested that the differentiation of these lineages could influence features such as vector competence (VC) and life table. With the aim of testing this hypothesis, female mosquitoes from both lineages collected from Bello were orally challenged with dengue virus serotype 2 (strain D2-HAN) to measure infection, dissemination, survival and fecundity. Analysis of VC showed an increase in viral titer over time; however, no significant differences were observed between the lineages. The survival rate was not different between the infected lineages, but comparing lineages, it was lower in infected mosquitoes, which may affect the intensity of transmission. Finally, we conclude that the genetic differentiation of Ae. aegypti into lineages did not confer differences in epidemiological status when the mosquitoes were infected with this D2 serotype strain.
