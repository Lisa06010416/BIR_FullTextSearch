From dengue to Zika: the wide spread of mosquito-borne arboviruses.
The worldwide invasion of arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses) in recent decades is responsible for emerging public health threats. Some factors like climate change, urbanisation and uncontrolled population growth are fuelling their widespread. Arboviruses incorporate a vast collection of genetically diverse viral pathogens including that of dengue, Zika and chikungunya. These viruses are peculiar as they are zoonotic and are a serious harm to the society, with no particular therapy to neutralise their effect. So it is the need of the hour to develop an effective treatment against infections caused by them. This review focuses on some of the common families of mosquito-borne arboviruses and their most known members that are a threat to mankind and discusses their genome organisation, worldwide spread and negative influence on public health.
