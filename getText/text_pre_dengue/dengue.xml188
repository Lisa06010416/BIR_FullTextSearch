Targeting intramolecular proteinase NS2B/3 cleavages for 
Many positive-strand RNA viruses translate their genomes as single polyproteins that are processed by host and viral proteinases to generate all viral protein products. Among these is dengue virus, which encodes the serine proteinase NS2B/3 responsible for seven different cleavages in the polyprotein. NS2B/3 has been the subject of many directed screens to find chemical inhibitors, of which the compound ARDP0006 is among the most effective at inhibiting viral growth. We show that at least three cleavages in the dengue polyprotein are exclusively intramolecular. By definition, such a
