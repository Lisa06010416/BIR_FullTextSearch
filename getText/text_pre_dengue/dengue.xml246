[The most frequent causative agents of Guillain-Barre syndrome in a Mexican general hospital].
After Zika virus outbreak and the increase in the incidence of Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS), the causal relationship has been studied, however a full etiological correlation has not been found.From January 1 to December 31, 2017, patients with GBS were included. In addition to the basic serologies, enterovirus, herpes, Campylobacter, hepatitis B and C, TORCH, HIV, Brucella and Salmonella were requested.Cohort of seven male patients. Five patients analyzed cerebrospinal fluid reporting normal; all of them underwent brain scan, reporting normal. Neuroconduction was performed, resulting in acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy in four cases and acute motor axonal neuropathy in one case. All received intravenous immunoglobulins, five cases had a good prognosis and two deaths. No positive cases were reported to Zika virus. A positive case was reported to dengue and another to chikungunya. Five positive cases were reported to Campylobacter. One case positive to enterovirus. Dengue + Campylobacter coinfections were reported in one case and chikungunya + Campylobacter in another case.The present cohort shows that it was not possible to establish a causal relationship between GBS and Zika virus, but other viral and bacterial causal agents were identified, such as dengue, chikungunya and enterovirus, with the identification of Campylobacter cases even more remarkable.
