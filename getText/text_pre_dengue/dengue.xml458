Exploring Dengue Proteome to Design an Effective Epitope-Based Vaccine against Dengue Virus.
Dengue, a mosquito-borne disease, is caused by four known dengue serotypes. This infection causes a range of symptoms from a mild fever, to a sever homorganic fever, and death. It is a serious public health problem in subtropical and tropical countries. There is no a specific vaccine currently available for clinical use and study on this issue is ongoing. In the current study, bioinformatics approaches were used to predict antigenic, immunogenic, non-allergenic and conserved B and T-cell epitopes as promising targets to design an effective peptide-based vaccine against dengue virus. Molecular docking analysis indicated the deep binding of the identified epitopes in the binding groove of the most popular human MHC I allele (HLA A*0201). The final vaccine construct was created by conjugating the B and T-cell identified epitopes using proper linkers and adding an appropriate adjuvant at the N-terminal. The characteristics of the new subunit vaccine demonstrated that the epitope-based vaccine was antigenic, non-toxic, stable, and soluble. Other physico-chemical properties of the new designed construct including isoelectric point value, aliphatic index and grand average of hydropathicity were biological considerable. Molecular docking of the engineered vaccine with TLR2 modeled revealed the hydrophobic interaction between the adjuvant and the ligand binding regions in the hydrophobic channel of TLR2. The study results indicated the high potential capability of the new multi-epitope vaccine to induce cellular and humoral immune responses against the dengue virus. Further experimental tests are required to investigate the immune protection capacity of the new vaccine construct in animal models.
