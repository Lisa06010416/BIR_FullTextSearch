Serological evidence of Japanese encephalitis virus circulation in Asian children from dengue-endemic countries.
Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) is a zoonotic, mosquito-borne flavivirus, distributed across Asia. Infections are mostly mild/asymptomatic but symptoms include neurological disorders, sequelae and fatalities. Data to inform control strategies are limited by incomplete case reporting. We used JEV serological data from a multi-country Asian dengue vaccine study in children aged 2-14 years to describe JEV endemicity by plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT50). 1479 unvaccinated subjects were included. A minimal estimate of pediatric JEV seroprevalence in dengue-na√Øve individuals was 8.1% in Indonesia, 5.8% in Malaysia, 10.8% in Philippines and 30.7% in Vietnam, translating to annual infection risks varying from 0.8% (in Malaysia) to 5.2% (in Vietnam). JEV seroprevalence and annual infection estimates were much higher in children with history of dengue infection, indicating cross-neutralization within the JEV PRNT50 assay. These data confirm JEV transmission across predominantly urban areas and support a greater emphasis on JEV case-finding, diagnosis and prevention.
