Comparison of two rapid diagnostic tests during a large dengue virus serotype 3 outbreak in the Solomon Islands in 2013.
Dengue virus (DENV) infection causes various clinical presentations, including asymptomatic infection, dengue with or without warning signs and severe dengue. An early and accurate diagnosis of DENV infection during the first few days of illness supports clinical management and significantly reduces dengue-associated mortality and morbidity. However, it is very difficult to confirm DENV infection in endemic regions without qualified dengue diagnostic laboratories. In this study, we evaluated the performance of two commercially available rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) using serum samples collected in the Solomon Islands during the 2013 DENV-3 outbreak. The sensitivity and specificity of the tests were calculated by comparing the results of DENV nonstructural protein 1 (NS1), IgM and IgG RDTs with those obtained by qRT-PCR. We also compared the results of the DENV IgM/IgG RDT with those obtained using an IgM/IgG capture enzyme-linked immune-sorbent assay (ELISA). The sensitivities of the SD and CTK NS1 RDTs were similar (90.9% and 92.6%), and the specificity of the SD NS1 RDT was significantly higher than that of the CTK NS1 RDT (100% versus 78.8%). The inclusion of IgM and IgG in the RDT did not significantly increase the sensitivity for DENV diagnosis. Compared with the SD IgM RDT, IgM capture ELISA had the same specificity but higher sensitivity. User-friendly RDTs remain the first choice and the most convenient tool in dengue endemic regions, where laboratory facilities and the corresponding infrastructure are lacking. Our study provided important and practical information for comparing the performance and validity of the different RDTs for rapid dengue detection.
