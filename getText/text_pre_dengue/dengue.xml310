Dengue seroprevalence and its socioeconomic determinants in Faisalabad, Pakistan: a cross-sectional study.
Socioeconomic disparities in the community make some groups more vulnerable to dengue infection.Fourteen dengue cases (IgM positive) served as index cases for the positive geographic cluster investigations.Of 292 individuals, the overall dengue seroprevalence was 22.9% (IgM positive 4.8%; IgG positive 18.1%). The highest (45%) seroprevalence was reported in the most socioeconomically vulnerable lower class, followed by the middle class (39%). Orthogonal comparisons showed that socioeconomic factors play a significant role in the prevalence of dengue.An integrated approach is required to control the menace through vector control strategies and improvement of socioeconomic conditions.
