DEET Efficacy Increases With Age in the Vector Mosquitoes Anopheles gambiae s.s. and Aedes albopictus (Diptera: Culicidae).
Old mosquitoes are the most likely to transmit pathogens due to the higher probability that they will be exposed to pathogens, and the time required before a mosquito becomes infectious, the extrinsic incubation period (EIP). However, old mosquitoes are rarely considered in the evaluation of control tools. This study evaluated the effect of mosquito aging on the repellent efficacy of N,N-diethyl-3-methylbenzamide (DEET) in two vector mosquitoes, Anopheles gambiae s.s. (Giles) (Diptera: Culicidae) and Aedes albopictus (Skuse) (Diptera: Culicidae), respective vectors of malaria parasites and arboviruses such as dengue, chikungunya, and Zika viruses. For both mosquito species, DEET-induced inhibition of blood-feeding was assessed in three age classes. Life-history traits related to mosquito fecundity and survival following DEET exposure were also measured. Results showed that, in both species, bloodmeal inhibition induced by DEET was significantly higher in old females (>18 d old) than in younger ones (<13 d old). Life history traits recording showed no combined effects of DEET and aging on mosquito blood engorgement, oviposition rate, number of eggs laid nor survival; however, age effects are reported for all these traits. These results highlight the need for taking into account mosquito age in the evaluation of integrated mosquito management tools. They also suggest that the control of vector-borne pathogens with a long EIP could be improved by targeting old mosquitoes and supports the efficacy of repellents in the fight against mosquito-borne diseases.
