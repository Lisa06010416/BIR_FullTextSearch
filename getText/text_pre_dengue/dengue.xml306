Experimental evaluation of the impact of household aerosolized insecticides on pyrethroid resistant Aedes aegypti.
The extensive reliance on insecticides to control Aedes aegypti mosquitoes and disrupt transmission of dengue, chikungunya and Zika has fueled the emergence of widespread resistance to insecticides. Mismatch between the frequency of pyrethroid resistance in mosquitoes and the occurrence of pyrethroid-based insecticide applications for vector control is often hypothesized to be due to household use of commercial insecticide products. We experimentally quantified phenotypic and genotypic responses of four Ae. aegypti strains (three field, pyrethroid resistant, and one laboratory, pyrethroid susceptible) after exposure to two commonly used household aerosol insecticide products (a space spray and a residual spray formulation) containing pyrethroid active ingredients. Experiments were performed within homes of MÃ©rida, Mexico. After exposure to the products, all three pyrethroid resistant field Ae. aegypti strains had significantly lower mortality rates (averaging 41% and 50% for the two products, respectively) than the controls (99%). Applying insecticides as surface sprays led to a significant increase in the frequency of I1016 kdr homozygotes in surviving Ae. aegypti, suggesting strong selection pressure for this allele. Given the large-scale use of household aerosol insecticide products in areas that are endemic for Ae. aegypti-transmitted diseases, their role as a pyrethroid resistance selection source, particularly when used as space sprays, should be taken into consideration when designing resistance management plans.
