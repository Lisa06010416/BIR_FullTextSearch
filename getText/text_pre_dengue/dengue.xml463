Detection of Zika, dengue and chikungunya viruses using single-reaction multiplex real-time RT-PCR.
Zika (ZIKV), Dengue (DENV) and Chikungunya viruses (CHIKV) co-circulate in the same geographical areas during the same seasonal period through the same biting arthropods. Therefore a rapid sensitive and specific molecular assay for these viruses would be a considerable help in the disease management and the epidemiological survey. We developed a one-step multiplex real-time PCR for the simultaneous detection of these viruses. Intra and inter-reproducibilities varied from 0.41% to 3.29% and from 1.13% to 4.93% for each virus respectively. The specificity was 100%. Whole blood, plasma and urines were used for comparison with commercially available monoplex assays (RealStarÂ® kits, Altona Diagnostics GmbH, Hamburg, Germany). The concordance was 96%, 92.9% and 95.7% for ZIKV, DENV and CHIKV respectively. No cross reaction and no PCR inhibition were observed for any of the clinical samples. This test can thus be used as a rapid molecular assay for ZIKV, DENV1-4 and CHIKV infections.
