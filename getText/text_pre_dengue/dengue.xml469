Development of a novel peptide aptamer-based immunoassay to detect Zika virus in serum and urine.
Zika virus (ZIKV) has been identified as a cause of adverse outcomes of pregnancy, including microcephaly and other congenital diseases. Most people infected with ZIKV do not show any symptoms. Development of a method to discriminate dengue virus (DENV) and ZIKV infections has been challenging, and efficient assays for patient management are limited, attributable to high levels of cross-reactivity among co-circulating
