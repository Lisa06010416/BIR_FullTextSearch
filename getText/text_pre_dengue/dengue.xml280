Circulating dengue virus serotypes in Bangladesh from 2013 to 2016.
To identify the circulating serotype(s) of dengue viruses in Bangladesh, a retrospective molecular identification was performed on stored serum samples of dengue surveillance during the period of 2013-2016. Real time RT-PCR was performed on serum samples collected from the patients with less than 5Â days fever for detection of dengue virus nucleic acid. The samples, positive for dengue PCR were further analyzed for serotypes by real time RT-PCR. The overall prevalence of dengue virus infection was varied among 13-42% in study years with a single peak flanked by April to September. Among the four dengue serotypes DEN1 and DEN2 were in the circulation in three metropolitan cities with sequential emergence of DEN1 where DEN2 was persisted constantly during the study period. Persistence of all four serotypes in the neighboring country makes Bangladesh vulnerable for devastating secondary infection by introduction of new serotype(s) other than currently circulating viruses in the country. Thus continuous virological surveillance is crucial for early warning of emergence of new serotype in the circulation and public health preparedness.
