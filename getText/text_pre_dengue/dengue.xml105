Microcystin and pyriproxyfen are toxic to early stages of development in Rhamdia quelen: An experimental and modelling study.
The recent increase of freshwater eutrophication has favored cyanobacteria blooms and consequently the increase of toxins such as microcystin-LR in aquatic environments, but few is know about the associated effect of toxin and other compounds. Pyriproxyfen is an insecticide indicated by WHO (World Health Organization) to control Aedes aegypti mosquito (vector of Dengue, Chikungunya and Zika diseases), however, the effects are not well described to non-target species, such as fish. The early life stages (ELS) of fish are more sensitive to chemical stress due to higher metabolic rate, immature immune system and high superficial area/volume ratio. In the current study, ELS of R. quelen a Neotropical fish were exposed to environmentally realistic concentrations of microcystin (1, 10 and 100 µg L
