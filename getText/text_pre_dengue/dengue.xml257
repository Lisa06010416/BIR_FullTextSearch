Burden of dengue among febrile patients at the time of chikungunya introduction in Piedecuesta, Colombia.
To estimate the age-specific incidence of symptomatic dengue and chikungunya in Colombia.A passive facility-based fever surveillance study was conducted among individuals with undifferentiated fever. Confirmatory diagnostics included serological and molecular tests in paired samples, and surveillance's underreporting was assessed using capture-recapture methods.Of 839 febrile participants 686 completed the study. There were 33.2% (295/839) dengue infections (51% primary infections), and 35.9% (191/532) of negative dengue cases there were chikungunya cases. On average, dengue cases were younger (median = 18 years) than chikungunya cases (median = 25 years). Thrombocytopaenia and abdominal pain were the main dengue predictors, while presence of rash was the main predictor for chikungunya diagnosis. Underreporting of dengue was 31%; the estimated expansion factors indicate an underreporting rate of dengue cases of threefold for all cases and of almost sixfold for inpatients.These findings highlight the ongoing coexistence of both arboviruses, a distinct clinical profile of each condition in the study area that could be used by clinicians to generate a differential diagnosis, and the presence of underreporting, mostly among hospitalised cases.
