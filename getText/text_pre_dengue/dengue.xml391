T Cell Responses to Nonstructural Protein 3 Distinguish Infections by Dengue and Zika Viruses.
The 2015-2016 Zika virus (ZIKV) epidemic in the Americas and the Caribbean demonstrated that clinical assays to detect, distinguish, and characterize immune responses to flaviviral infections are needed. ZIKV and dengue virus (DENV) are mosquito-transmitted flaviviruses sharing overlapping geographic distributions and have significant sequence similarities that can increase the potential for antibody and T cell cross-reaction. Using nonstructural protein 1-based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs), we determined the serostatus of individuals living in a region of DENV and ZIKV endemicity in Brazil, identifying individuals with primary DENV (pDENV) and primary ZIKV (pZIKV), ZIKV with primary DENV (ZIKVwpDENV), and secondary DENV (sDENV) infections; the presence of pDENV and pZIKV was further confirmed by neutralization tests. Development of an enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot (ELISPOT) assay for DENV and ZIKV structural and nonstructural (NS) protein antigens enabled us to distinguish infections by these viruses based on T cell responses and to characterize those responses. We found that gamma interferon (IFN-γ) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) T cell responses to NS3 differentiated DENV and ZIKV infections with 94% sensitivity and 92% specificity. In general, we also showed that pDENV and sDENV cases and pZIKV and ZIKVwpDENV cases elicit similar T cell response patterns and that HIV-infected individuals show T cell responses that are lower than those shown by HIV-negative individuals. These results have important implications for DENV and ZIKV diagnostic and vaccine development and provide critical insights into the T cell response in individuals with multiple flaviviral infections.
