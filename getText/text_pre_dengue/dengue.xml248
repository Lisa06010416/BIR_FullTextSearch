Modeling the spatially varying risk factors of dengue fever in Jhapa district, Nepal, using the semi-parametric geographically weighted regression model.
Dengue fever is expanding rapidly in many tropical and subtropical countries since the last few decades. However, due to limited research, little is known about the spatial patterns and associated risk factors on a local scale particularly in the newly emerged areas. In this study, we explored spatial patterns and evaluated associated potential environmental and socioeconomic risk factors in the distribution of dengue fever incidence in Jhapa district, Nepal. Global and local Moran's I were used to assess global and local clustering patterns of the disease. The ordinary least square (OLS), geographically weighted regression (GWR), and semi-parametric geographically weighted regression (s-GWR) models were compared to describe spatial relationship of potential environmental and socioeconomic risk factors with dengue incidence. Our result revealed heterogeneous and highly clustered distribution of dengue incidence in Jhapa district during the study period. The s-GWR model best explained the spatial association of potential risk factors with dengue incidence and was used to produce the predictive map. The statistical relationship between dengue incidence and proportion of urban area, proximity to road, and population density varied significantly among the wards while the associations of land surface temperature (LST) and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) remained constant spatially showing importance of mixed geographical modeling approach (s-GWR) in the spatial distribution of dengue fever. This finding could be used in the formulation and execution of evidence-based dengue control and management program to allocate scare resources locally.
