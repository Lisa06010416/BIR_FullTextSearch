Case Report: Right Hemispheric Neuroimaging Abnormalities in a Patient with Dengue Encephalopathy.
Dengue encephalitis and dengue encephalopathy are frequent neurological complications of systemic dengue virus infection. Neuroimaging is normal in approximately 50% of patients. Common imaging abnormalities involve periventricular structures, including the basal ganglion, thalamus, and periventricular white matter. We describe an unusual case of dengue encephalopathy with unilateral imaging abnormalities involving the right cerebral hemisphere and mimicking the involvement of the right middle cerebral artery.
