Need for guidelines for the combined management of pregnancy and dengue: a retrospective study from an Indian tertiary care maternity hospital.
The incidence of dengue has risen in India in recent years. Evidence suggests that dengue in pregnancy may be associated with adverse maternal and fetal outcomes. The aim of our study was to analyse outcomes in pregnant women with confirmed dengue infection who had the benefit of close monitoring and intensive management at a tertiary maternity facility. We reviewed hospital data of 44 (0.11%) such women at Fernandez Hospital, a tertiary maternity unit, during the five-year period from 2011 to 2016. Maternal and fetal variables were collected from case sheets. Dengue haemorrhagic fever was seen in 15.9% and dengue shock syndrome in one fatal case (2.2%). Thrombocytopenia was seen in 31 cases (70.4%) and 14 (31.81%) received platelets transfusions. Fetal outcomes in our series were favourable, except for one stillbirth, with 45.4% preterm deliveries and 15.9% small for gestational age babies. Dengue in pregnancy is definitely associated with maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality. A high index of suspicion of dengue is required in pregnant women with pyrexia and thrombocytopenia.
