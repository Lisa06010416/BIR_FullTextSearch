Infectious uveitis: an Asian perspective.
Several intraocular infections can present with protean manifestations posing major diagnostic and management challenges. Infections such as tuberculosis, dengue and chikungunya fever have continued to remain major endemic diseases that are associated with uveitis in the Asia Pacific region. These entities often require a high index of clinical suspicion and laboratory analysis including assays of ocular fluids and/or tissues for confirmation of the diagnosis. Infectious uveitis caused by tuberculosis, dengue and chikungunya can present with characteristic clinical features and imaging findings on ancillary investigations; that may provide clue to the early diagnosis. Use of modern imaging modalities such as enhanced-depth imaging optical coherence tomography, optical coherence tomography angiography and ultra-wide field fundus photography greatly aid in the evaluation of these conditions. In the current review, we have discussed the epidemiology, clinical phenotypes, imaging characteristics, diagnosis and management of uveitis caused by tuberculosis, dengue and chikungunya.
