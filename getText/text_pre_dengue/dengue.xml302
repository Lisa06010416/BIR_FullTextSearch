Interferon-stimulated TRIM69 interrupts dengue virus replication by ubiquitinating viral nonstructural protein 3.
In order to eliminate viral infections, hundreds of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) are induced via type I interferons (IFNs). However, the functions and mechanisms of most ISGs are largely unclear. A tripartite motif (TRIM) protein encoding gene TRIM69 is induced by dengue virus (DENV) infection as an ISG. TRIM69 restricts DENV replication, and its RING domain, which has the E3 ubiquitin ligase activity, is critical for its antiviral activity. An in vivo study further confirmed that TRIM69 contributes to the control of DENV infection in immunocompetent mice. Unlike many other TRIM family members, TRIM69 is not involved in modulation of IFN signaling. Instead, TRIM69 interacts with DENV Nonstructural Protein 3 (NS3) directly and mediates its polyubiquitination and degradation. Finally, Lys104 of NS3 is identified as the target of TRIM69-mediated ubiquitination. Our study demonstrates that TRIM69 restricts DENV replication by specifically ubiquitinating a viral nonstructural protein.
