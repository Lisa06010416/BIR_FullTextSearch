Host Genetic Polymorphisms Influencing Susceptibility to Dengue.
Dengue is a pandemic-prone viral disease which is endemic in more than 100 countries and which puts half of the world's population at risk. While the disease presents as subclinical infection or mild fever in the majority of cases, approximately a quarter of the infected individuals experience severe forms of disease like dengue hemorrhagic fever/dengue shock syndrome that cause significant rates of mortality and morbidity. The pathogenesis of this differential outcome of infection is determined by a complex interplay of factors associated with the virus, vector, and host; much of which is not completely understood. In this review, we present an update on the various host genetic polymorphisms that have been reported to influence the susceptibility to dengue. For the convenience of discussion, we have categorized the genetic factors according to the different arms of the immune system with which the corresponding immune determinants are associated.
