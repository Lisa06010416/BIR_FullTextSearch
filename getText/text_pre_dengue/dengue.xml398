Co-circulation of four dengue serotypes at South Eastern Andhra Pradesh, India: A prospective study.
Dengue is one of the most important mosquito-borne viral diseases in the world. The emergence and spread of four dengue viruses (DENVs) (serotypes) represent a global pandemic. The four distinct serotypes are, namely, DENV-1, DENV-2, DENV-3 and DENV-4. Very few dengue serotyping studies have been reported from Andhra Pradesh. In this context, the present study focuses on the circulating serotypes of dengue in South-Eastern Andhra Pradesh.Study was done at Sri Venkateswara Institute of Medical Sciences, a teaching hospital in Tirupati, Andhra Pradesh. Acute phase dengue serum samples were collected and tested for NS1 antigen and anti-human IgM antibodies by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). NS1-positive samples were further serotyped by reverse transcriptase real-time polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).A total of 398 serum samples were received from clinically suspected dengue fever cases. Of these, 150 (37.7%) samples were positive for NS1 and/or IgM ELISA. The 96 NS1 antigen-positive samples were further processed for serotyping, of which 36 were negative by rRT-PCR. DENV-2 (41%) was the predominant serotype, followed by DENV-4 (37%), DENV-3 (12%) and DENV-1 (10%) in descending order.This study reports the all four dengue serotypes' co-circulation. This is the first report from South Eastern Andhra Pradesh. Amongst four, DENV-2 was predominant followed by DENV-4. The information of predominant serotypes can guide in forecasting dengue outbreaks and improving control measures of vectors thus may be helpful in the prevention of outbreaks.
