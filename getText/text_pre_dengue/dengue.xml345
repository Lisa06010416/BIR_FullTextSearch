Augmented Zika and dengue neutralizing antibodies are associated with Guillain-Barré syndrome.
The role of neutralizing antibodies in Zika-induced Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) has not yet been investigated. We conducted a case-control study using sera from the 2016 Zika epidemic in Colombia to determine the neutralizing antibody activity against Zika virus (ZIKV) and dengue virus serotype 2 (DENV2). We observed increased neutralizing antibody titers against DENV2 in ZIKV-infected individuals compared to uninfected controls and higher titers to both ZIKV and DENV2 in ZIKV-infected patients diagnosed with GBS compared to non-GBS ZIKV infected controls. These data suggest that high neutralizing antibodies titers to DENV and to ZIKV are associated with GBS during ZIKV infection.
