Knowledge, practices and entomological aspects of dengue in Medellín, Colombia: A comparative study of neighborhoods with high and low incidence
Introduction: Dengue, mainly transmitted by Aedes aegypti, is a very important viral disease in terms of public health. Colombia is an endemoepidemic country for dengue and, in cities like Medellín, there are neighborhoods with high and low incidence. The disease dynamics in the neighborhoods might be determined by differences in the knowledge, practices and entomological aspects of the vector among the communities.
Objective: To identify the knowledge and practices of residents of neighborhoods with high and low incidence of dengue, and to explore the entomological aspects related to the presence of the vector.
Materials and methods: We conducted a cross-sectional study comparing two neighborhoods with high incidence and two with low incidence during the triennium of 2013-2015. A random sample of 100 houses per neighborhood was selected in order to evaluate the knowledge, practices and entomological aspects related to dengue. In addition, descriptive, bivariate and multivariate analyses (logistic regression) were performed.
Results: In neighborhoods with high incidence, participants had not attended school or had only a primary school level of education (OR=1.69; 95% CI: 1.09-2.63). Additionally, they did not have health coverage or belonged to the subsidized regime (OR=2.16; 95% CI: 1.41-3.32). In contrast, they had a greater knowledge of the vector (OR=1.53; 95% CI: 1.00-2.35). In terms of practices, there was a greater chance of finding houses where water was stored (OR=1.69; 95% CI: 1.11-2.57) and regarding the entomological aspects, more houses with adult mosquitoes were found (OR=2.13 95% CI: 1.29-3.50).
Conclusions: We found important differences among the neighborhoods regarding knowledge, practices, and the presence of adult stages of the vector, which helps to explain the epidemiology of dengue in these sites.
