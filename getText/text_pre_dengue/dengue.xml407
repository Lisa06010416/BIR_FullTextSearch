Genetic characterization of chikungunya viruses isolated during the 2015-2017 outbreaks in different states of India, based on their E1 and E2 genes.
During 2015-2017, chikungunya virus (CHIKV) showed a resurgence in several parts of India with Karnataka, Maharashtra and New Delhi accounting for a majority of the cases. E2-E1 gene based characterization revealed Indian subcontinent sublineage strains possessing Aedes aegypti mosquito-adaptive mutations E1: K211E and E2:V264A, with the 211 site positively selected. Novel mutational sites E1: K16E/Q, E1: K132Q/T, E1: S355T, E2: C19R and E2:S185Y could be associated with epitopes or virulence determining domains. The study examines the role of host, vector and viral factors and fills gaps in our molecular epidemiology data for these regions which are known to possess a dynamic population.
