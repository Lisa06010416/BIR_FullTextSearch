Discovery of Indole Derivatives as Novel and Potent Dengue Virus Inhibitors.
3-Acyl-indole derivative 1 was identified as a novel dengue virus (DENV) inhibitor from a DENV serotype 2 (DENV-2) phenotypic antiviral screen. Extensive SAR studies led to the discovery of new derivatives with improved DENV-2 potency as well as activity in nanomolar to micromolar range against the other DENV serotypes. In addition to the potency, physicochemical properties and metabolic stability in rat and human microsomes were improved during the optimization process. Chiral separation of the racemic mixtures showed a clear preference for one of the two enantiomers. Furthermore, rat pharmacokinetics of two compounds will be discussed in more detail, demonstrating the potential of this new series of pan-serotype-DENV inhibitors.
