Assessment of insecticide resistance in primary dengue vector, Aedes aegypti (Linn.) from Northern Districts of West Bengal, India.
Aedes mosquitoes are the major vectors transmitting several arboviral diseases such as dengue, zika and chikungunya worldwide. Northern districts of West Bengal is home to several epidemics vectored by mosquito including dengue infections, proper control of which depends on efficient vector control. However the onset of insecticide resistance has resulted in failure of vector control approaches. This study was carried out to unveil the level of insecticide resistance prevailing among the primary dengue vector in this dengue endemic region of India. It was observed that, field caught populations of Ae. aegypti were moderately to severely resistant to majority of the insecticide classes tested, i.e. Organochlorine (DDT), Organophosphates (temephos, malathion), Synthetic Pyrethroids (deltamethrin, lambdacyhalothrin and permethrin) and carbamate (propoxur). In majority of the populations, metabolic detoxification seemed to play the underlying role behind the development of insecticide resistance. This study seems to be the first report revealing the pattern of insecticide resistance in Ae. aegypti from Northern West Bengal. Efficient disease management in this region can only be achieved through proper insecticide resistance management. This study may help the concerned authorities in the formulation of an effective vector control strategy throughout this region incorporating the knowledge gained through this study.
