B cell subset alteration and the expression of tissue homing molecules in dengue infected patients.
B cells play an essential role during dengue viral infection. While a major expansion of antibody secreting cells (ASCs) was observed, the importance of these increased frequencies of ASCs remains unclear. The alteration of B cell subsets may result from the expression of tissue specific homing molecules leading to their mobilization and distribution to different target organs during acute dengue viral infection.In this study, whole blood samples were obtained from thirty pediatric dengue-infected patients and ten healthy children and then stained with fluorochrome-conjugated monoclonal antibodies against CD3, CD14, CD19, CD20, CD21, CD27, CD38, CD45, CD138 and homing molecules of interest before analyzed by polychromatic flow cytometry. B cell subsets were characterized throughout acute infection period.Data shows that there were no detectable differences in frequencies of resting, activated and tissue memory cells, whereas the frequency of ASCs was significantly increased and associated with the lower frequency of na√Øve cells. These results were found from patients with both dengue fever and dengue hemorrhagic fever, suggesting that such change or alteration of B cells was not associated with disease severity. Moreover, several homing molecules (e.g., CXCR3 and CCR2) were found in ASCs, indicating that ASCs may distribute to inflamed tissues and various organs.Findings from this study provide insight into B cell subset distribution. Furthermore, organ mobilization according to homing molecule expression on different B cell subsets during the course of dengue viral infection also suggests they are distributed to inflamed tissues and various organs.
