An Innovative Multiplexed And Flexible Molecular Approach For The Differential Detection Of Arboviruses.
Nucleic acid testing during the preseroconversion viremic phase is required to differentially diagnose arboviral infections. The continuing emergence of arboviruses such as Zika (ZIKV), dengue (DENV), and chikungunya (CHIKV) viruses necessitates the development of a flexible diagnostic approach. Similar clinical signs and the priority to protect pregnant women from ZIKV infection indicate that the differential diagnosis of arboviruses is essential for effective patient management, clinical care, and epidemiological surveillance. Here, we describe an innovative diagnostic approach combining generic reverse transcription-PCR amplification and identification by hybridization to specific probes. Original tetrathiolated probes were designed for the robust, sensitive, and specific detection of amplified arboviral genomes. The limit of detection using cultured and quantified stocks of whole viruses was 1 TCID
