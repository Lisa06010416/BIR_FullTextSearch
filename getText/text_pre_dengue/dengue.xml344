Dengue infection in international travellers visiting Bali, Indonesia.
Dengue, an acute febrile illness caused by infection with dengue virus (DENV), is endemic in Bali, Indonesia. As one of the world's most popular tourist destinations, Bali is regularly visited by domestic and international travellers, who are prone to infection by endemic pathogens, including DENV. Currently, limited data are available on the characteristics of dengue in travellers visiting Bali. Information on the epidemiology and virological aspects of dengue in these tourists is important to gain a better understanding of the dengue disease in international travellers.We performed a prospective cross-sectional dengue study involving foreign travellers visiting Bali, Indonesia in the period of 2015-17. Patients presenting at Kasih Ibu Hospital with fever and clinical symptoms of dengue were asked to participate in the study. Clinical and laboratory assessments were performed and sera were collected for molecular analysis, which included DENV serotyping, genome sequencing and phylogenetic analysis.Among the 201 patients recruited, dengue was confirmed in 133 (66.2%) of them, based on detection of NS1 antigen and/or viral RNA. Of these, 115 (86.5%) manifested dengue fever (DF) and 18 (13.5%) dengue haemorrhagic fever (DHF). The temporal predominance of infecting DENV serotype was DENV-2 (48.7%), followed by DENV-3 (36.1%), DENV-1 (9.2%) and DENV-4 (3.4%). Phylogenetic analysis of DENV based on envelope gene sequences revealed that the source of DENVs was local endemic viruses.Our study confirms that dengue is one of the causes of fever in travellers visiting Bali. Although it is a cause of significant morbidity, the majority of patients only experienced mild DF, with only a small proportion developing DHF. We revealed that DENVs isolated were autochthonous. Accurate diagnosis, preventive measures and continuous disease surveillance will be useful for better management of dengue infection in travellers.
