[Ocular manifestations of emerging arboviruses: Dengue fever, Chikungunya, Zika virus, West Nile virus, and yellow fever (French translation of the article)].
Arboviruses are viral diseases transmitted by mosquitoes and tics bites. They are a major cause of morbidity and sometimes mortality. Their expansion is constant and due in part to climate change and globalization. Mostly found in tropical regions, arboviruses are sometimes the source of epidemics in Europe. Recently, the Chikungunya virus and the Zika virus were responsible for very large epidemics impacting populations that had never been in contact with those viruses. There are currently no effective antiviral treatments or vaccines. Ocular manifestations due to those infections are thus more frequent and increasingly better described. They are sometimes, as with Zika, complicated by a congenital ocular syndrome. The goal of this review is to describe the ophthalmological manifestations of Dengue fever, Chikungunya virus, Zika virus, West Nile virus, and yellow fever.
