Raman spectroscopy based differentiation of typhoid and dengue fever in infected human sera.
This study investigated the potential of Raman spectroscopy, to differentiate between two different types of human pathological conditions with some symptom similarity; typhoid and dengue. Raman spectra were recorded from 20 Salmonella Typhi infected and 22 dengue virus (DENV) infected sera samples using laser wavelength 785 nm. When Raman spectrum (540 to 1830 cm ) of serum samples was compared it showed significant variations. Twelve characteristic Raman bands at 562, 649, 716, 780, 838, 1099, 1144, 1156, 1260, 1386, 1556 and 1746 cm  were recorded specifically in case of the typhoid infected samples, whereas four Raman bands at 756, 1218, 1672 and 1686 cm  were found specifically in the DENV infected samples. For statistical differentiation principal component analysis (PCA) and linear discriminant analysis (LDA) was applied which successfully separated two sets of data. These disease specific Raman signatures may be labeled as biomarkers for identification as well as differential diagnosis of typhoid and dengue infection. Hence we propose that Raman spectroscopy has the potential to not only identify but also to differentiate between different pathological conditions, having some similar symptoms like high grade fever in this case.
