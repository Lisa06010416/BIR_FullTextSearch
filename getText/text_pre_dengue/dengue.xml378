Interleukin-33 contributes to disease severity in Dengue virus infection in mice.
The excessive inflammation often present in patients with severe dengue infection is considered both a hallmark of disease and a target for potential treatments. Interleukin-33 (IL-33) is a pleiotropic cytokine with pro-inflammatory effects whose role in dengue has not been fully elucidated. We demonstrate that IL-33 plays a disease-exacerbating role during experimental dengue infection in immunocompetent mice. Mice infected with dengue virus serotype 2 (DENV2) produced high levels of IL-33. DENV2-infected mice treated with recombinant IL-33 developed markedly more severe disease compared with untreated mice as assessed by mortality, granulocytosis, liver damage and pro-inflammatory cytokine production. Conversely, ST2  mice (deficient in IL-33 receptor) infected with DENV2 developed significantly less severe disease compared with wild-type mice. Furthermore, the increased disease severity and the accompanying pathology induced by IL-33 during dengue infection were reversed by the simultaneous treatment with a CXCR2 receptor antagonist (DF2156A). Together, these results indicate that IL-33 plays a disease-exacerbating role in experimental dengue infection, probably driven by CXCR2-expressing cells, leading to elevated pro-inflammatory response-mediated pathology. Our results also indicate that IL-33 is a potential therapeutic target for dengue infection.
