Morphology of the eggs surface of ten Brazilian species of phlebotomine sandflies (Diptera: Psychodidae).
The chorionic sculpturing of ten Brazilian sandfly species, Nyssomyia antunesi (Coutinho), N. whitmani (Antunes and Coutinho), Bichromomyia flaviscutellata (Mangabeira), B. olmeca nociva (Young and Arias), Evandromyia walkeri (Newstead), E. williamsi (Antunes and Coutinho), Deanemyia maruaga (Alves, Freitas and Barrett), D. samueli (Deane), Viannamyia furcata (Mangabeira) and Lutzomyia dispar (Martins and Silva), was examined using scanning electron microscopy. Eggs of the last seven species, as well as the genera Deanemyia and Viannamyia, are described for the first time. In total, five patterns of chorionic sculpturing were found: polygonal, connected parallel ridges, unconnected parallel ridges, volcano-like and placoid. The last one is a new chorionic sculpture pattern, which was observed in D. samueli. These structures are illustrated and discussed. These results show that egg morphology can be used in phlebotomine taxonomy, both at generic and specific levels.
