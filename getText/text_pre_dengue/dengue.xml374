First documented evidence of dengue and malaria co-infection in children attending two health centers in Yaoundé, Cameroon.
To date, only a few cases of malaria and dengue co-infections have been reported around the world. We describe for the first time in Cameroon, concurrent infections among children (2 to 10 years) in two health centers of Yaoundé. The two dengue strains isolated in Cameroon clustered with the Asian II genotype. Although acute concurrent infections were benign, special attention should be given to malaria and dengue co-infection in order to prevent possible severe cases.
