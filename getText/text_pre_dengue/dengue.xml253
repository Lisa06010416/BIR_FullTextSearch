[Guidelines for diagnosis and treatment of dengue in China].
Dengue is the most prevalent and rapidly spreading mosquito-borne viral disease. As a dengue non-endemic country, China has experienced several dengue outbreaks in recent years. However, dengue patients in China displayed distinct clinical characteristics compared to patients in endemic countries. To standardize the diagnosis and treatment of dengue fever, the experts of the Society of Infectious Diseases, Society of Tropical Medicine and Parasitology of Chinese Medical Association, and the Society of Emergency Medicine, China Association of Chinese Medicine have reached this guideline based on guidelines for diagnosis, treatment, prevention and control of dengue (World Health Organization, 2009); guidelines for diagnosis and treatment of dengue (National Health and Family Planning Commission of the People's Republic of China, 2014, Edition 2), health industry standard of the People's Republic of China "diagnosis for dengue fever (WS216-2018)" and systemic reports on dengue. The guideline includes 8 aspects: introduction, terminology, epidemiology and prevention, etiology and pathogenesis, clinical features, diagnosis, treatment and problems to be solved.
