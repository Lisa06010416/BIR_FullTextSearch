Dengue fever manifesting with tetany as the first presentation of primary hypoparathyroidism: a case report.
Primary hypoparathyroidism is associated with diverse variety of symptomatology of hypocalcemia including seizures and tetany. We report a case of previously undiagnosed asymptomatic primary hypoparathyroidism with extensive basal ganglia calcifications presenting for the first time with hypocalcemic tetany during acute dengue infection. Although hypocalcemia is known to occur in dengue infection symptomatic hypocalcemia is very infrequent.A 32 year old male with short stature who has undergone bilateral cataract surgery 2 years ago but who was otherwise healthy, presented with fever and generalized body aches of 3 days duration and carpal spasms/tetany occurring on the third day of the illness. He was diagnosed to have acute dengue fever along with severe hypocalcemia. Subsequent workup confirmed that the patient had primary hypoparathyroidism with extensive basal ganglia and cerebellar calcifications which was previously undiagnosed. His acute illness and hypocalcemia was managed successfully and was commenced on regular calcium supplementations to alleviate the hypocalcemic effects of his chronic illness.Clinical features of hypocalcemia may not commonly manifest up to the same degree of severity of hypocalcemia in primary hypoparathyroidism even till late adulthood but potential early clues such as short stature and premature cataract should be actively investigated. Worsening of already existing hypocalcemia during acute dengue fever led to the ultimate diagnosis of primary hypoparathyroidism in this patient which was lifesaving.
