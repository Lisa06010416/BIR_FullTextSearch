Methods for Lipid Droplet Biophysical Characterization in 
Lipid droplets (LDs) are intracellular organelles for neutral lipid storage, originated from the endoplasmic reticulum. They play an essential role in lipid metabolism and cellular homeostasis. In fact, LDs are complex organelles, involved in many more cellular processes than those initially proposed. They have been extensively studied in the context of LD-associated pathologies. In particular, LDs have emerged as critical for virus replication and assembly. Viruses from the
