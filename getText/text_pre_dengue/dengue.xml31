Emerging arboviruses and implications for pediatric transplantation: A review.
Recent years have brought a rise in newly emergent viral infections, primarily in the form of previously known arthropod-transmitted viruses that have increased significantly in both incidence and geographical range. Of particular note are DENV, CHIKV, and ZIKV, which are transmitted mostly by Aedes species of mosquitoes that exhibit a wide and increasing global distribution. Being important pathogens for the general population, these viruses have the potential to be devastating in the international transplant community, with graft rejection and death as possible outcomes of infection. In this review, we discuss the current state of knowledge for these viruses as well as repercussions of infection in the solid organ and HSCT population, with a focus, when possible, on pediatric patients.
