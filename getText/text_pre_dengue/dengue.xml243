Genetic variability of Aedes aegypti in the department of Sucre, Colombia, by analysis of the nucleotide sequence of the mitochondrial ND4 gene
Introduction. Aedes aegypti is the most important mosquito species in America for the transmission of viruses of dengue, Zika, Chikungunya and yellow fever. Ecological factors as well as chemical controls can affect the genetic composition of Ae. aegypti populations, which is why its genetic characterization is necessary.
Objective. To determine the genetic variability of Ae. aegypti populations in four municipalities of Sucre department, Colombia.
Materials and methods. Larvae of Ae. aegypti, collected in the municipalities of Sincelejo, Sampués, Corozal and Guaranda, Sucre department, were reared under laboratory conditions to adult stage. A segment of the mitochondrial ND4 gene which codes for the subunit 4 of the enzyme NADH-dehydrogenase was used as genetic marker. The genetic analysis included the estimation of parameters of nucleotide and haplotype diversity, genetic structure and gene flow.
Results. One hundred and eight partial sequences of 357 nucleotides and four nucleotide haplotypes of the ND4 gene of Ae. aegypti were obtained. A significantly high genetic differentiation was found between the Sampués and Guaranda populations (FST=0.59467), Sincelejo and Sampués (FST=0.25637), and Corozal and Guaranda (FST=0.22237). A high gene flow (Nm=infinite) was observed among the populations of Sincelejo and Corozal.
Conclusion. There are genetic differences between the Ae. aegypti populations from the municipalities of Sucre department. The presence of a new haplotype of the mitochondrial ND4 gene of Ae. aegypti in Colombia was recorded, detected in the municipality of Sincelejo.
