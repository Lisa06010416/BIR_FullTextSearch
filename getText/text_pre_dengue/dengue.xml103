Using bioinformatics tools for the discovery of Dengue RNA-dependent RNA polymerase inhibitors.
Dengue fever has rapidly manifested into a serious global health concern. The emergence of various viral serotypes has prompted the urgent need for innovative drug design techniques. Of the viral non-structural enzymes, the NS5 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase has been established as a promising target due to its lack of an enzymatic counterpart in mammalian cells and its conserved structure amongst all serotypes. The onus is now on scientists to probe further into understanding this enzyme and its mechanism of action. The field of bioinformatics has evolved greatly over recent decades, with updated drug design tools now being publically available.In this study, bioinformatics tools were used to provide a comprehensive sequence and structural analysis of the two most prominent serotypes of Dengue RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. A list of popular Comparative sequence alignment exhibited similarity between all three domains of serotype 2 and 3.Sequence analysis revealed highly conserved regions at residues Meth530, Thr543 Asp597, Glu616, Arg659 and Pro671. Mapping of the active site demonstrated two highly conserved residues: Ser710 and Arg729. Of the active site interacting residues, Ser796 was common amongst all ten docked compounds, indicating its importance in the drug design process. Of the ten docked This study utilized publically available bioinformatics tools to provide a comprehensive framework on Dengue RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. Based on docking studies, a pharmacophore model was also designed to unveil the crucial pharmacophoric elements that are required when constructing an efficacious DENV inhibitor. We believe that this study will be a cornerstone in paving the road toward the design of target-specific inhibitors against DENV RdRp.
