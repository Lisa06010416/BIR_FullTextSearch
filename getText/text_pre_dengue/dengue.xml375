An epidemiological study of dengue and its coinfections in Delhi.
To study the epidemiology of dengue with reference to serological, demographic profile, spatio-temporal distribution, vectors, circulating serotypes and coinfections.Demographic data and presenting symptoms of fever cases reporting to the clinic were recorded. Suspected patients were tested for dengue, chikungunya and malaria. Dengue specific RT-PCR was performed to detect circulating DENV serotypes. Vector surveys were carried out to detect Aedes breeding.Of the 5536 fever patients tested during 2012 to 2015, 1536 (27.7%) had confirmed dengue. The peak in dengue positivity was observed during September and October. Of the 60 samples analysed, 10 (16.7%) had concurrent infection with multiple dengue serotypes; one of them had all the four serotypes. Coinfection of dengue with malaria and chikungunya was also observed. The occurrence of dengue and malaria was inversely related. Seven percent of the dengue patients required hospitalization. Vector surveys in the draining area revealed Aedes breeding with a high house index.Delhi being hyperendemic, the occurrence of concurrent infections with multiple DENV serotypes has become a frequent finding. The study emphasizes the need of epidemiological and entomological surveillance to monitor trends in dengue distribution, seasonal patterns and circulating serotypes to guide dengue control activities.
