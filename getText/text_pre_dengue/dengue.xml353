Using a virion assembly-defective dengue virus as a vaccine approach.
Dengue virus (DENV) is the most prevalent mosquito-transmitted viral pathogen in humans. The recently licensed dengue vaccine has major weaknesses. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop improved dengue vaccines. Here we report a virion assembly-defective DENV as a novel vaccine platform. DENV containing an amino acid deletion (K188) in nonstructural protein 2A (NS2A) is fully competent in viral RNA replication, but is completely defective in virion assembly. When
