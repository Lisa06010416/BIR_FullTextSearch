Differential Proteome Analysis of Chikungunya Virus and Dengue Virus Coinfection in Aedes Mosquitoes.
Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) and dengue virus (DENV) are important arboviruses transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes. These viruses are known to coexist within the same vector and coinfect the same host. Although information is available on the mechanism of replication of CHIKV and DENV when present independently in a vector, reports are lacking on the dynamics of virus-vector interactions when these viruses coexist in a mosquito. The current study attempts to understand the perturbations in the proteome of Aedes mosquitoes when infected with CHIKV and DENV either independently or together. Global proteome profiling of chikungunya and dengue mono- and coinfection revealed 28 proteins to be significantly regulated. Validation of the transcripts of these proteins using qRT-PCR indicated differences in the expression patterns between transcript profiling and quantitative proteome analyses. Pathway analysis of the 28 differentially regulated proteins revealed 11 significant pathways, which include oxidative phosphorylation, carbon metabolism, and glycolysis/gluconeogenesis.
