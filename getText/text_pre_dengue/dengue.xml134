Hypometabolic strategy and glucose metabolism maintenance of Aedes aegypti egg desiccation.
The mosquito Aedes aegypti is vector of several viruses including yellow fever virus, dengue virus chikungunya virus and Zika virus. One of the major problems involving these diseases transmission is that A. aegypti embryos are resistant to desiccation at the end of embryogenesis, surviving and remaining viable for several months inside the egg. Therefore, a fine metabolism control is essential to support these organisms throughout this period of resistance. The carbohydrate metabolism has been shown to be of great importance during arthropod embryogenesis, changing dramatically in order to promote growth and differentiation and in periods of resistance. This study investigated fundamental aspects of glucose metabolism in three stages of A. aegypti egg development: pre-desiccated, desiccated, and rehydrated. The activities of regulatory enzymes in carbohydrate metabolism such as pyruvate kinase, hexokinase and glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase were evaluated. We show that these activities were reduced in A. aegypti desiccated eggs, suggesting a decreased activity of glycolytic and pentose phosphate pathway. In contrast, gluconeogenesis increased in desiccated eggs, which uses protein as substrate to synthesize glucose. Accordingly, protein amount decreased during this stage, while glucose levels increased. Glycogen content, a major carbohydrate reserve in mosquitoes, was evaluated and shown to be lower in desiccated and rehydrated eggs, indicating it was used to supply energy metabolism. We observed a reactivation of carbohydrate catabolism and an increased gluconeogenesis after rehydration, suggesting that controlling glucose metabolism was essential not only to survive the period of desiccation, but also for subsequent larvae hatch. Taken together, these results contribute to a better understanding of metabolism regulation in A. aegypti eggs during desiccation periods. Such regulatory mechanisms enable higher survival rate and consequently promote virus transmission by these important disease vectors, making them interesting subjects in the search for novel control methods.
