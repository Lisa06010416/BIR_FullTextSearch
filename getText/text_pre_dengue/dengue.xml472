Mathematical assessment of the role of Dengvaxia vaccine on the transmission dynamics of dengue serotypes.
A new mathematical model is designed and used to assess the impact of the newly-released Dengvaxia vaccine on the transmission dynamics of two co-circulating dengue strains (where strain 1 consists of dengue serotypes 1, 3 and 4; and strain 2 consists of dengue serotype 2). It is shown that the model exhibits the phenomenon of backward bifurcation when the disease-induced mortality in the host population exceeds a certain threshold value or if the vaccine does not provide perfect protection against infection with the two strains. In the absence of backward bifurcation, the disease-free equilibrium of the model is shown to be globally-asymptotically stable whenever the associated reproduction number is less than unity. It is shown that the community-wide use of the vaccine could induce positive, negative or no population-level impact, depending on the sign of a certain epidemiological threshold quantity (known as the vaccine impact factor). Simulations of the model, using data from Oaxaca, Mexico, show that, although the community-wide use of the vaccine will significantly reduce dengue burden in the community, it is unable to lead to the elimination of the two dengue strains. It is further shown that the use of Dengvaxia vaccine in dengue-naive populations may induce increased risk of severe disease in these populations.
