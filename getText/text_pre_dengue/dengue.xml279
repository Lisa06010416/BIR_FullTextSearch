Characterization of Tolypocladium cylindrosporum (Hypocreales, Ophiocordycipitaceae) isolates from Brazil and their efficacy against Aedes aegypti (Diptera, Culicidae).
To survey and to characterize entomopathogenic fungi as natural enemies of mosquitoes in Central Brazil.Tolypocladium cylindrosporum (Hypocreales, Ophiocordycipitaceae) was isolated for the first time in South America by using Aedes aegypti (Diptera, Culicidae) as sentinel larvae in a stagnant mosquito breeding site in a secondary tropical forest. Two isolates were morphologically and molecularly identified, and their activity tested against A. aegypti eggs, larvae and adults.Findings emphasize the importance of T. cylindrosporum as a natural fungal antagonist of mosquitoes.Both isolates affected larvae and adults but were less effective against eggs; both have potential for development as a mycoinsecticide especially against larvae of A. aegypti the main vector of dengue, chikungunya, Zika and urban yellow fever.
