Association of Dengue with Longitudinally Extensive Transverse Myelitis and Subarachnoid Hemorrhage: An Unusual Presentation.
Association of dengue fever with transverse myelitis is a rare phenomenon; involvement of a long segment is even rarer. We describe a middle-aged female who presented with weakness of bilateral lower limbs and urinary retention 4 days after recovery from dengue fever. She, in addition, had a sensory level up to the level of nipples. Magnetic resonance imaging confirmed the diagnosis of longitudinally extensive transverse myelitis. Besides, the patient had spontaneous subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) in the absence of dengue hemorrhagic fever. The patient was started on steroids along with rehabilitation. Our case highlights the extensive involvement of spinal cord in the postinfectious phase of dengue and inclusion of this arboviral disease in the differential diagnoses of myelitis as well as an etiology of SAH.
