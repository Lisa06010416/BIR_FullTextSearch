Transcriptomic Analysis of Aedes aegypti in Response to Mosquitocidal Bacillus thuringiensis LLP29 Toxin.
Globally, Aedes aegypti is one of the most dangerous mosquitoes that plays a crucial role as a vector for human diseases, such as yellow fever, dengue, and chikungunya. To identify (1) transcriptomic basis of midgut (2) key genes that are involved in the toxicity process by a comparative transcriptomic analysis between the control and Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) toxin (LLP29 proteins)-treated groups. Next-generation sequencing technology was used to sequence the midgut transcriptome of A. aegypti. A total of 17130 unigenes, including 574 new unigenes, were identified containing 16358 (95.49%) unigenes that were functionally annotated. According to differentially expressed gene (DEG) analysis, 557 DEGs were annotated, including 226 upregulated and 231 downregulated unigenes in the Bt toxin-treated group. A total of 442 DEGs were functionally annotated; among these, 33 were specific to multidrug resistance, 6 were immune-system-related (Lectin, Defensin, Lysozyme), 28 were related to putative proteases, 7 were lipase-related, 8 were related to phosphatases, and 30 were related to other transporters. In addition, the relative expression of 28 DEGs was further confirmed through quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction. The results provide a transcriptomic basis for the identification and functional authentication of DEGs in A. aegypti.
