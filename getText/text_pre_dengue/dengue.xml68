Prostaglandin A1 triggers Mayaro virus inhibition and heat shock protein 70 expression in an epithelial cell model.
The Mayaro virus (MAYV), which is an arbovirus closely related to the Chikungunya virus, causes a dengue-like acute illness that is endemic to Central and South America. We investigated the anti-MAYV activity of prostaglandin A1 (PGA1), a hormone which exhibits antiviral activity against both ribonucleic acid (RNA) and deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) viruses. Further, we examined the effects of inducting the stress protein HSP70 following PGA1 treatment.Hep-2 cells infected with MAYV were treated with PGA1 (0.1-6Î¼g/ml) 12h before infection and for different periods post-infection. Inhibition of viral replication inhibition was analyzed via viral titer determination, whereas the effect of PGA1 on viral morphogenesis was examined via transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Autoradiography (with 35S methionine labeling) and western blotting were used to assess the effect of PGA1 treatment on viral and cellular protein synthesis, and on HSP70 induction, respectively.PGA1 strongly reduced viral replication in Hep-2 cells, particularly when added during the early stages of viral replication. Although PGA1 treatment inhibited viral replication by 95% at 24 hours post-infection (hpi), viral structural protein synthesis was inhibited only by 15%. TEM analysis suggested that PGA1 inhibited replication before viral morphogenesis. Western blot and densitometry analyses showed that PGA1 treatment increased HSP70 protein levels, although this was not detectable via autoradiography.PGA1 inhibits MAYV replication in Hep-2 cells at early stages of viral replication, prior to production of viral structural proteins, possibly via HSP70 induction.
