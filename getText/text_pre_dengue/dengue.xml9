An unusual occurrence of stromal keratitis in dengue fever.
Dengue is a mosquito-borne infection endemic in the tropical and subtropical regions of the world. Classic dengue fever is a self-limiting, influenza-like illness transmitted by Aedes aegypti mosquito. Ophthalmic manifestations though rare can involve both the anterior and posterior segments and are usually associated with the thrombocytopenic state. However, ophthalmic complications such as anterior uveitis and vasculitis suggest immune-mediated pathogenesis. Herein, we report a rare case of stromal keratitis and an unusual occurrence of simultaneous bilateral blindness following dengue fever in a young girl.
