The role of lipids in the inception, maintenance and complications of dengue virus infection.
Dengue fever is a viral condition that has become a recurrent issue for public health in tropical countries, common endemic areas. Although viral structure and composition have been widely studied, the infection phenotype in terms of small molecules remains poorly established. This contribution providing a comprehensive overview of the metabolic implications of the virus-host interaction using a lipidomic-based approach through direct-infusion high-resolution mass spectrometry. Our results provide further evidence that lipids are part of both the immune response upon Dengue virus infection and viral infection maintenance mechanism in the organism. Furthermore, the species described herein provide evidence that such lipids may be part of the mechanism that leads to blood-related complications such as hemorrhagic fever, the severe form of the disease.
