Serological Evidence of Dengue and West Nile Virus Human Infection in Juarez City, Mexico.
Arboviruses are significant causes of human and animal diseases, globally. In the Rio Grande Valley of the United States-Mexico border region, endemic transmission of Dengue (DENV), Zika (ZIKV), and West Nile (WNV) viruses have been documented as a cause of human disease. Otherwise, very little is known about the distribution of arboviruses and their possible cause of human disease in other areas of the United States-Mexico border region. Therefore, a pilot serosurvey was conducted to determine if there was evidence of DENV and WNV infection among a human cohort in Anapra, Ciudad Juarez, Mexico. Baseline blood samples were obtained from 78 participants during May-June, 2015 and from 60 of the same participants again during November-December, 2015, and all the samples were tested for DENV and WNV indirect immunoglobulin G antibodies by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT). The results showed that 14.1% (n = 11) of the 78 participants had neutralizing antibody to DENV and 5.13% (n = 4) had WNV-neutralizing antibody. Among 48 of 60 participants who were negative for DENV and WNV antibody during the baseline survey, 10.4% (n = 5) had acquired antibody to DENV (n = 4) and WNV (n = 1) by the second survey during November-December, 2015. These data support the local transmission of DENV and WNV in the Anapra, Ciudad Juarez community and therefore warrant further epidemiological studies to better understand the dynamics of transmission of these viruses in this United States-Mexico border city.
