Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease is associated with increased hemoconcentration, thrombocytopenia, and longer hospital stay in dengue-infected patients with plasma leakage.
A prominent histopathological feature of fatal dengue cases is hepatic steatosis. However, the association between hepatic steatosis and dengue severity is unknown. We conducted a study to determine the associations of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) with laboratory markers of dengue severity and length of hospital stay (LOS). A retrospective study was conducted at a private hospital in Jakarta, Indonesia, from December 2011 to December 2016. Bivariate analysis was performed to analyze the associations of laboratory markers of dengue severity and LOS with the presence or absence of NAFLD in no-plasma-leakage (no leakage) and plasma-leakage (leakage) groups. There were 267 dengue-infected patients included in this study. Of these patients, 115 (43.1%) were classified as belonging to the no leakage group, and 152 (56.9%) were classified as belonging to the leakage group. Of the 115 patients belonging to the no leakage group, 53 (46.1%) did not have NAFLD, and 62 (53.9%) had NAFLD. Of the 152 patients belonging to the leakage group, 85 (55.9%) did not have NAFLD, and 67 (44.1%) had NAFLD. Leakage group patients with NAFLD experienced significantly higher hemoconcentration severity (p = 0.04), lower platelet count (p = 0.004) and higher LOS (p = 0.042) than did leakage group patients without NAFLD. The presence of NAFLD in dengue-infected patients with plasma leakage was associated with more severe hemoconcentration, thrombocytopenia and prolonged hospital stay.
