First Report on Detection of Dengue Virus in the Donor Cornea.
Dengue fever is the most prevalent form of flavivirus infection in humans. We have investigated whether corneoscleral tissue of the donor affected by dengue virus (DENV) harbors the virus.To identify the risk for viral transmission through corneal transplants in areas where DENV circulates.Excised corneoscleral tissue from a cadaver with a history of viral hemorrhagic fever was analyzed using reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction for the presence of DENV and chikungunya virus (CHIV).DENV was detected in RNA extracted from the donor corneoscleral rim. Further genotyping of the viral isolate from the virus-infected cell harvest revealed DENV type 3 as the causative agent. CHIV was not detected.The data presented in this study recommend the implementation of polymerase chain reaction for detection of DENV and CHIV to analyze excised corneoscleral tissue of a donor with viral hemorrhagic fever.
