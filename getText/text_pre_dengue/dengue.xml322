Etiology and Outcomes of ARDS in a Resource Limited Urban Tropical Setting.
Several studies have been published in the western literature on the incidence, clinical course and outcome of patients with ARDS. However, there is limited data about ARDS in the tropics and moreover, the etiology and outcomes of ARDS in tropical countries are different from those of western nations. In tropical countries like India, resources are limited and costs of therapy play a major role in deciding treatment options. This prospective observational study was designed to analyze the clinical profile, outcomes and predictors of mortality of patients with ARDS in an urban tropical setting.75 patients ≥13 years, admitted in the medical intensive care unit of a teaching hospital in Kerala, India between March 2013 and February 2014, satisfying Berlin definition for ARDS were enrolled in the study. Lung protective ventilation strategy as laid by ARDS Network protocol was followed for every patient on mechanical ventilation. Due to scarcity of ventilators in our institution, invasive ventilation could not be provided for all ARDS patients. The criteria used for patient selection for non-invasive ventilation were hemodynamic stability, well compliant to the use of NIV mask and PaO2/FiO2 ratio >180 at the time of admission.Out of the 75 patients, 51% were females and the mean age of the study population was 39.8 ± 3.3 years. Common aetiologies were leptospirosis (18.7%), bronchopneumonia (17.3%), scrub typhus and dengue (12% each). Lung injury score and sequential organ failure assessment score scores had statistically significant association with the severity of ARDS. Forty patients (53.3%) received invasive mechanical ventilation and 35 patients were managed with non-invasive ventilation at the time of admission. The mortality in our study was 45%. Altered sensorium (p-0.002), central cyanosis (p-0.024), elevated creatinine (p-0.036), acidosis (p < 0.001), hypotension (p < 0.001), multiorgan dysfunction (p-0.017), PEEP >12 cm H2O (p-0.036), days on ventilator <7 (p-0.014), PaO2/FiO2 Ratio <100 (p < 0.001), LIS>2.5 (p < 0.001) and SOFA score>11 (p < 0.001) were individual predictors of mortality.Tropical infections form a major etiological component of ARDS in a developing country like India. More studies are required for determining criteria for using NIV in mild ARDS patients which would be helpful in resource limited countries. Timely administration of effective antimicrobial therapy in patients in the rural tropics may help to reduce mortality and financial burden due to ARDS.
