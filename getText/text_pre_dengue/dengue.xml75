A simple mathematical model to describe antibody-dependent enhancement in heterologous secondary infection in dengue.
We develop a mathematical model to describe the role of antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) in heterologous secondary infections, assuming that antibodies specific to primary dengue virus (DENV) infection are being produced by immunological memory. The model has a virus-free equilibrium (VFE) and a unique virus-presence equilibrium (VPE). VFE is asymptotically stable when VPE is unstable; and unstable, otherwise. Additionally, there is an asymptotic attractor (not a fixed point) due to the fact that the model assumes unbounded increase in memory cells. In the analysis of the model, ADE must be accounted in the initial stage of infection (a window of time of few days), period of time elapsed from the heterologous infection until the immune system mounting an effective response against the secondary infection. We apply the results yielded by model to evaluate ADE phenomonon in heterologous DENV infection. We also associate the possible occurrence of severe dengue with huge viremia mediated by ADE phenomenon.
