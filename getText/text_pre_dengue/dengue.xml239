Potent neutralizing human monoclonal antibodies preferentially target mature dengue virus particles: implication for novel strategy of dengue vaccine.
The four serotypes of dengue virus (DENV) cause the most important mosquito-borne viral disease in humans. The envelope (E) protein is the major target of neutralizing antibodies and contains 3 domains (DI, DII and DIII). Recent studies reported that human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) recognizing the DIII, D1/DII hinge, the E-dimer epitope or a quaternary epitope involving DI/DII/DIII are more potently neutralizing compared with those recognizing the fusion-loop (FL) of DII. Due to inefficient cleavage of premembrane protein, DENV suspensions consist of a mixture of mature, immature and partially immature particles. We investigated the neutralization and binding of 22 human mAbs to DENV1 virions with differential maturation status. Compared with FL mAbs, DIII, DI/DII hinge and E-dimer epitope mAbs showed higher maximum binding and avidity to mature particles relative to immature particles; this feature may contribute to the strong neutralizing potency of such mAbs. FL-specific mAbs required 57 to 87% occupancy on mature particles to achieve half maximal neutralization (NT
