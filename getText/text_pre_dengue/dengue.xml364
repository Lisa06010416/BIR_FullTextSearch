Classification of dengue cases in Southwest India based on the WHO systems-a retrospective analysis.
The WHO dengue classification 1997 was revised in 2009 and the revised classification system has now been in use for the past decade. This study was carried out to compare the 1997 and revised classifications in assessing the severity of dengue infection among all age groups during a dengue outbreak in southwest India.This retrospective cross-sectional study was carried out including serologically confirmed dengue cases. A total of 1033 dengue cases were classified on the basis of the 1997 WHO classification and 2009 revised classification. The statistical analysis was carried out using SPSS 15.0 for Windows (SPSSTM Inc, Chicago, IL, USA).Both the 1997 and revised WHO classifications were applied to 1033 confirmed dengue cases, including 692 males (67%) and 341 females (33%). The median age of the study participants was 23 years (IQR 10-33), including 112 (10.8%) children at and below the age of 5 years. The level of agreement between the two systems of classification was poor (kappa=0.143, 0.055-0.198, p-value <0.001).A greater sensitivity and specificity of the revised classification was observed in comparison with the 1997 WHO classification. In the context of changing dengue epidemiology and geographical expansion, the revised classification is helpful in the identification of severe cases, facilitating timely management.
