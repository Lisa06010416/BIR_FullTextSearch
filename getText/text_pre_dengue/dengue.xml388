Lessons learnt from managing a case of dengue hemorrhagic fever complicated with acute liver failure and acute kidney injury: a case report.
Dengue is a common arboviral infection with a diverse spectrum of clinical manifestations. Dengue hemorrhagic fever is a more severe form of infection characterized by plasma leak and hemoconcentration. Although hepatic dysfunction is common in dengue illness, massive liver necrosis is rarely reported. Lactic acidosis is a poor prognostic marker in liver failure related to dengue. Management of acute renal injury in dengue hemorrhagic fever due to prolonged shock is challenging as the fluid reabsorption during the recovery phase expands the intravascular volume and precipitates heart failure and pulmonary edema.We report the case of a 43-year-old Sri Lankan Sinhalese woman with serologically confirmed dengue fever presenting with evidence of plasma leakage developing acute liver failure evidenced by deranged liver functions, coagulopathy, and altered sensorium and acute kidney injury with anuria. She had elevated serum lactate levels. In addition to the "standard care," she was managed with intravenously administered N-acetyl cysteine and blood transfusions, even in the absence of bleeding or dropping packed cell volume, targeting a higher packed cell volume anticipating a better oxygenation at tissue level. Continuous veno-venous hemodialysis was employed and continued for 138Â hours removing the fluids reabsorbed during the recovery phase to prevent her from developing heart failure and pulmonary edema. She made full recovery with no sequelae.N-acetyl cysteine and packed cell transfusion aiming at a higher packed cell volume to maintain adequate tissue perfusion during shock may be beneficial in acute liver failure due to dengue virus. The use of a continuous form of renal replacement such as continuous veno-venous hemodialysis is of paramount importance in managing fluid states in the recovery phase of dengue hemorrhagic fever in those with renal impairment. Interesting observations made in the fluid dynamics during the reabsorption phase need further studies preferably with an animal model.
