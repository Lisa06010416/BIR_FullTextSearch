Mosquito-borne transmission in urban landscapes: the missing link between vector abundance and human density.
With escalating urbanization, the environmental, demographic, and socio-economic heterogeneity of urban landscapes poses a challenge to mathematical models for the transmission of vector-borne infections. Classical coupled vector-human models typically assume that mosquito abundance is either independent from, or proportional to, human population density, implying a decreasing force of infection, or
