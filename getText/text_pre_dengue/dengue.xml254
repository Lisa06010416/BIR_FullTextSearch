Correlation between adult pyrethroid resistance and knockdown resistance (kdr) mutations in Aedes albopictus (Diptera: Culicidae) field populations in China.
Arboviral disease transmitted by Aedes albopictus such as dengue fever is an important threat to human health. Pyrethroid resistance raises a great challenge for mosquito control. A systematic assessment of Ae. albopictus resistance status in China is urgently needed, and the study of correlation between pyrethroid resistance and knockdown resistance (kdr) mutations would provide information to guide the control of the Ae. albopictus vector.Five field populations of Ae. albopictus were collected from Jinan (JN), Hangzhou (HZ), Baoshan (BS), Yangpu (YP) and Haikou (HK), China in 2017. Insecticide-impregnated papers were prepared with four pyrethroid chemicals, deltamethrin, permethrin, beta-cypermethrin and lambda-cyhalothrin. The susceptibility of Ae. albopictus to pyrethroids was tested by the WHO tube assay. Kdr mutations were identified by PCR and sequencing. Moreover, the correlation analysis between kdr alleles and pyrethroid resistance was performed.All five populations of Ae. albopictus showed resistance to four pyrethroid insecticides. One kdr mutant allele at codon 1532 and three at 1534 were detected with frequency of 5.33% (I1532T), 44.20% (F1534S), 1.83% (F1534 L) and 0.87% (F1534C), respectively. Both 1532 and 1534 mutation mosquitoes were found in the BS and YP populations. Allele I1532T was negatively correlated with deltamethrin resistance phenotype (OR < 1), while F1534S mutation was positively correlated with deltamethrin and permethrin resistance (OR > 1).The five field populations of Ae. albopictus adults were all resistant to deltamethrin, permethrin, beta-cypermethrin and lambda-cyhalothrin. Mutant F1534S was clearly associated with pyrethroid resistance phenotype in Ae. albopictus and this could be developed as a molecular marker to monitor the pyrethroid resistance problem in China.
