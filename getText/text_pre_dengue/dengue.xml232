Comprehensive characterisation of polyphenols in leaves and stems of three anti-dengue virus type-2 active Brazilian Faramea species (Rubiaceae) by HPLC-DAD-ESI-MS/MS.
The methanol (MeOH) leaf extracts of the species Faramea bahiensis, F. hyacinthina and F. truncata (Rubiaceae) have previously shown in vitro non-cytotoxic and anti-dengue virus serotype 2 (DENV2) activities in human hepatocarcinoma cell lineage (HepG2). Chemical studies have led to the isolation of major flavonoids, but quite complex fractions of phenolic compounds still remain.To complete the study of phenolic compounds in the leaves and to access the presence of these compounds in the stems of these Faramea spp. by online high-performance liquid chromatography-diode array detector-electrospray ionisation tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-DAD-ESI-MS/MS), as well as to evaluate the in vitro cytotoxic and anti-DENV2 activities of their MeOH stem extracts.The identification was performed by comparing retention times, UV and mass spectra with those of available standards and by using the mechanisms and fragmentation patterns established in previous studies. The effects of the extracts in DENV2 infected HepG2 cell viability was determined by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. The virus titer was quantified by plaque assay.The study led to the characterisation of 31 phenolic compounds including flavonoid O- and C-glycosides, phenolic acids and one coumarin. The stem extracts from F. hyacinthina and F. bahiensis presented a similar bioactivity to those of their leaves but a loss of cytoprotective activity of F. bahiensis and a higher cytotoxicity of F. truncata were observed.This research allowed a detailed phenolic composition of three bioactive Faramea species to be achieved, thus contributing to the study of this genus and providing valuable information for further phytotherapeutic applications.
