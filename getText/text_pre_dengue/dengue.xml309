Multifocal motor neuropathy presenting as a post-infectious complication of dengue: a CASE report.
Dengue infection is an endemic illness in the tropics and it is associated with a wide variety of post infectious complications. With the increasing prevalence of dengue infection in endemic regions, post-infectious neurological complications following dengue infection are now been reported more frequently. We report a patient who developed multifocal motor neuropathy (MMN) with conduction blocks following dengue infection during the immediate post-infectious period. MMN is a rare neurological disorder with an autoimmune etiology and to best of our knowledge this is the first reported case of MMN occurring following dengue infection as a post dengue neurological complication.A 20Â year old Sri Lankan male who was treated for serologically confirmed dengue infection presented to us with 1 month history of bilateral hand weakness which has started 5 days after the dengue infection (5 days after the discharge). On examination he had asymmetrical motor weakness of the hands and to a lesser degree in feet. There was no sensory impairment. Nerve conduction studies confirmed MMN with conduction blocks. He was started on intravenous immunoglobulin therapy for which he showed a good response.The authors report the first case of MMN complicating dengue fever in a previously healthy male from Sri Lanka. Thus it should be borne in mind that although rare, MMN can occur as a post-infectious complication of dengue fever.
