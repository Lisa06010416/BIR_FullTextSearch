Potential for the Invasive Species Aedes Albopictus and Arboviral Transmission through the Chabahar Port in Iran.
Dengue, chikungunya, and Zika viruses are emerging infectious disease threats wherever suitable vectors, hosts, and habitat are present. The aim of the present study was to use the bioagent transport and environmental modeling system (BioTEMS) to identify the potential for arbovirus-infected ArcGIS geospatial analysis software, Statistica software, and BioTEMS were used to analyze geographic information and conduct data analysis. BioTEMS utilizes up to several hundred abiotic and biotic factors to produce risk and vulnerability assessments for biological agents and infectious diseases. The output of BioTEMS was validated using published predictive models, and most importantly published collection data of There appears to have been two separate invasion events by The air and maritime ports of Iran serve international customers, and are therefore vulnerable to import and invasion of mosquito vectors and arboviruses. Based on comparisons with other published low-resolution models, BioTEMS provides information for medical and public health professionals conducting integrated mosquito management, preventive medicine, and epidemiological surveillance.
