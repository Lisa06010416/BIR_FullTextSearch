Flaviviruses and the Central Nervous System: Revisiting Neuropathological Concepts.
Flaviviruses are major emerging human pathogens on a global scale. Some flaviviruses can infect the central nervous system of the host and therefore are regarded as neurotropic. The most clinically relevant classical neurotropic flaviviruses include Japanese encephalitis virus, West Nile virus, and tick-borne encephalitis virus. In this review, we focus on these flaviviruses and revisit the concepts of flaviviral neurotropism, neuropathogenicity, neuroinvasion, and resultant neuropathogenesis. We attempt to synthesize the current knowledge about interactions between the central nervous system and flaviviruses from the neuroanatomical and neuropathological perspectives and address some misconceptions and controversies. We hope that revisiting these neuropathological concepts will improve the understanding of flaviviral neuroinfections. This, in turn, may provide further guiding foundations for relevant studies of other emerging or geographically expanding flaviviruses with neuropathogenic potential, such as Zika virus and dengue virus, and pave the way for intelligent therapeutic strategies harnessing potentially beneficial, protective host responses to interfere with disease progression and outcome.
