Screening for Zika virus RNA in sera of suspected cases: a retrospective cross-sectional study.
Zika virus (ZIKV) became a global human health concern owing to its rapid spread worldwide and its association with congenital and neurological disorders. The current epidemiological profile of arboviruses in Brazil is characterized by widespread co-circulation of Dengue virus, Chikungunya virus, and ZIKV throughout the country. These viruses cause acute diseases frequently with overlapping symptoms, which could result in an inaccurate diagnosis based solely on clinical and epidemiological grounds. Here we conducted a screening for ZIKV RNA in serum samples from patients across Brazil with suspected ZIKV infection.Using RT-qPCR, we investigated ZIKV RNA in 3001 serum samples. Samples were passively acquired through a private laboratory network, between December 2015 and August 2016, from 27 Brazilian Federative Units. We performed descriptive statistics on demographic variables including sex, age, and geographic location.ZIKV was detected in 11.4% (95%CI = 10.3-12.6%) of the sera. ZIKV RNA was detected in sera collected throughout the country, but during the analyzed period, RNA was more frequently detected in samples from the Southeast, Midwest, and North regions (3.9 to 5.8 times higher) when compared to the Northeast and South regions.These data reinforce the importance of laboratory diagnosis, surveillance systems, and further epidemiological studies to understand the dynamics of outbreaks and diseases associated with ZIKV and other arboviruses.
