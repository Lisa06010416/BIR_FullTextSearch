Dengue fever an emerging public health concern in Metropolitan city of Multan: Its Sero-prevalence and associated risk factors.
We investigated sero-prevalence of dengue antibodies Immunoglobulin G (IgG) and Immunoglobulin M (IgM), in 689 dengue suspected patients. Of 689 suspected cases, 373 (54.1%) were found positive for dengue antibodies while IgM dominated most. The seasonal distribution found significant relationship between dengue fever and season, and all cases were reported during rainy season with no case during dry season, while the post-monsoon season was most affected (89.5%). The percentage of male cases and age group between 21-49 years were reported far more with 79.3% and 63% respectively.
