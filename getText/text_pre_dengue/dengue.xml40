Human MxB inhibits the replication of HCV.
Type I interferon (IFN) inhibits viruses through inducing the expression of antiviral proteins. The IFN-induced myxovirus resistance B (MxB) protein has been reported to inhibit a limited number of viruses including HIV-1 and herpesviruses, its antiviral coverage remains to be further explored. Here, we find that MxB interferes with RNA replication of Hepatitis C virus (HCV) and significantly inhibits viral replication in a cyclophilin A (CypA)-dependent manner. Our data further show that MxB interacts with HCV protein NS5A, thereby impairing NS5A interaction with CypA and NS5A localization to the endoplasmic reticulum, two events essential for HCV RNA replication. Interestingly, we find that MxB significantly inhibits two additional CypA-dependent viruses of the
