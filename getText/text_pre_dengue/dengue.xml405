Opsoclonus-myoclonus-ataxia syndrome associated with chikungunya and dengue virus co-infection.
Opsoclonus-myoclonus-ataxia syndrome (OMAS) is a rare neurological disorder characterized by irregular multidirectional eye movements, myoclonus, cerebellar ataxia, sleep disturbances, and cognitive dysfunction. Although most commonly related to paraneoplastic syndrome, this condition has occasionally been described following infectious illnesses. This article reports the first case of OMAS in association with chikungunya and dengue virus co-infection. The genetic analysis identified chikungunya virus of East/Central/South African genotype and dengue serotype 4 virus of genotype II. This report represents an unusual clinical syndrome associated with viral co-infection and reinforces the need for clinical vigilance with regard to neurological syndromes in the context of emergent arboviruses.
