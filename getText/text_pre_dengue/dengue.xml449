DC-SIGN Binding Contributed by an Extra N-Linked Glycosylation on Japanese Encephalitis Virus Envelope Protein Reduces the Ability of Viral Brain Invasion.
The major structural envelope (E) protein of Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) facilitates cellular binding/entry and is the primary target of neutralizing antibodies. JEV E protein has one N-linked glycosylation site at N154 (G2 site), but the related dengue virus E protein has two glycosylation sites at N67 (G1 site) and N153 (G2 site). We generated three recombinant JEVs with different glycosylation patterns on the E protein. As compared with wild-type (WT) JEV with G2 glycosylation, viral growth in culture cells as well as neurovirulence and neuroinvasiveness in challenged mice were reduced when infected with the G1 mutant (E-D67N/N154A) with glycosylation shifted to G1 site, and the G0 mutant (E-N154A) with non-glycosylation. The G1G2 mutant (E-D67N), with E-glycosylation on both G1 and G2 sites, showed potent
