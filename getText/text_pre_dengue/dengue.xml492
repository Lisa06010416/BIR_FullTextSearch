Detection of Dengue Virus among Children with Suspected Malaria, Accra, Ghana.
We report new molecular evidence of locally acquired dengue virus infections in Ghana. We detected dengue viral RNA among children with suspected malaria by using a multipathogen real-time PCR. Subsequent sequence analysis revealed a close relationship with dengue virus serotype 2, which was implicated in a 2016 outbreak in Burkina Faso.
