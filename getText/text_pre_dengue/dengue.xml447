Structure-based prediction of West Nile virus-human protein-protein interactions.
In recent years, West Nile virus (WNV) has posed a great threat to global human health due to its explosive spread. Studying the protein-protein interactions (PPIs) between WNV and human is beneficial for understanding the pathogenesis of WNV and the immune response mechanism of human against WNV infection at the molecular level. In this study, we identified the human target proteins which interact with WNV based on protein structure similarity, and then the interacting pairs were filtered by the subcellular co-localization information. As a result, a network of 3,346 interactions was constructed, involving 6 WNV proteins and 1970 human target proteins. To our knowledge, this is the first predicted interactome for WNV-human. By analyzing the topological properties and evolution rates of the human target proteins, it was demonstrated that these proteins tend to be the central and bottleneck proteins in the human PPI network and are more conserved than the non-target ones. Triplet analysis showed that the target proteins are adjacent to each other in the human PPI network, suggesting that these proteins may have similar biological functions. Further, the functional enrichment analysis indicated that the target proteins are mainly involved in virus process, transcription regulation, cell adhesion and so on. In addition, the common and specific targets were identified and compared based on the networks between WNV-human and Dengue virus II (DENV2)-human. Finally, by combining topological features and existing drug target information, we identified 30 potential anti-WNV human targets, among which 11 ones were reported to be associated with WNV infection.
