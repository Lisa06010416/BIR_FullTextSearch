Vaccine Demand and Willingness-to-pay for Arbovirus Vaccines: A Cross-sectional Survey in Rural Guatemala.
Arboviruses including dengue (DENV), chikungunya (CHIKV) and Zika cause significant morbidity in Latin America. With multiple arbovirus vaccines in development, better understanding of community attitudes and acceptability for these vaccines is needed.In September 2016, a cross-sectional survey assessed arbovirus knowledge, attitudes, vaccine demand and willingness-to-pay (WTP) at the conclusion of a DENV/norovirus surveillance study in rural Guatemala with high arbovirus endemicity. Factors associated with vaccine demand and WTP were assessed with regression analysis.Among 564 surveyed households, DENV knowledge was high. There was great concern for arboviruses, particularly CHIKV. Overall vaccine attitudes were positive with <5% identifying significant barriers, hesitancy or refusing previous vaccination. At 50% and 75% efficacy, 75% and 88% of respondents wanted arbovirus vaccines, respectively. DENV vaccine demand at 50% efficacy was associated with increased housing density, nonhealth postvaccination location, older children and medical source for information. For each vaccine, 52-55% of respondents were WTP $0-$3.40, while 16-17% were WTP ≥$6.81. WTP at $3.40 and $6.81 levels for all vaccines was associated positively with parental education but negatively with good DENV knowledge. History of purchasing and identifying barriers to vaccines was associated with WTP ≥$6.81.Demand for potential DENV, CHIKV and Zika vaccines is high at 50% and 75% efficacy in this Guatemalan community. Associated factors could be leveraged to optimize arbovirus vaccine implementation. Overall low WTP given current cost of Dengvaxia (Sanofi Pasteur, Lyon, France) suggests that government subsidization may be necessary in resource-poor regions, though a small private market may be supported.
