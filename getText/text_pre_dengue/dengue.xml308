Investigation of the Plasma Virome from Cases of Unexplained Febrile Illness in Tanzania from 2013 to 2014: a Comparative Analysis between Unbiased and VirCapSeq-VERT High-Throughput Sequencing Approaches.
High-throughput sequencing can provide insights into epidemiology and medicine through comprehensive surveys of viral genetic sequences in environmental and clinical samples. Here, we characterize the plasma virome of Tanzanian patients with unexplained febrile illness by using two high-throughput sequencing methods: unbiased sequencing and VirCapSeq-VERT (a positive selection system). Sequences from dengue virus 2, West Nile virus, human immunodeficiency virus type 1, human pegivirus, and Epstein-Barr virus were identified in plasma. Both sequencing strategies recovered nearly complete genomes in samples containing multiple viruses. Whereas VirCapSeq-VERT had better sensitivity, unbiased sequencing provided better coverage of genome termini. Together, these data demonstrate the utility of high-throughput sequencing strategies in outbreak investigations.
