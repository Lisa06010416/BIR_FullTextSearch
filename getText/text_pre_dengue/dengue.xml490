Distinguishing Zika and Dengue Viruses through Simple Clinical Assessment, Singapore.

We showed in a case-control discovery cohort, and replicated in a validation cohort, that the diagnostic indices of conjunctivitis, platelet count, and monocyte count reliably distinguished between these viruses.
