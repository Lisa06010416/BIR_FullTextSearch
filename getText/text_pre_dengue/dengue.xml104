Identification of Differentially Expressed Genes in BALB/c Mouse Liver upon Primary Infection with DENV1 and Sequential Heterologous Infection with DENV2.
Dengue virus (DENV) results in 100 million cases of infections and 22,000 deaths per year. Liver involvement, thrombocytopenia, haemorrhage and plasma leakage are characteristic manifestations of severe forms of DENV infection. However, the molecular pathways of DENV infection have not been comprehensively studied compared to the host immunological responses. We performed an in vivo study using the BALB/c mouse model with a modified mRNA differential display methodology (GeneFishing ) using the annealing control primer (ACP) system to capture differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in mice liver upon primary infection with DENV1 and sequential heterologous infection with DENV2. Secondary heterologous infection with DENV2 was carried out at Immunoglobulin IgM and IgG peaks following the primary DENV1 infection with the hope of determining any potential effect antibodies IgM and IgG may have on sequential heterologous infection. 30 DEGs were identified and sequenced across all three treatment groups and they belong to a variety of important pathways such as apoptosis, innate immune response, inflammatory response, metabolic processes and oxidative stress. Analysis of differentially expressed genes in response to viral infection offers valuable knowledge about the dynamic and complex association between host cell and the virus. Furthermore, some DEGs identified support DENV induced liver damage.
