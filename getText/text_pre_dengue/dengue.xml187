SIR Model for Dengue Disease with Effect of Dengue Vaccination.
The dengue disease is caused by dengue virus, and there is no specific treatment. The medical care by experienced physicians and nurses will save life and will lower the mortality rate. A dengue vaccine to control the disease is available in Thailand since late 2016. A mathematical model would be an important way to analyze the effects of the vaccination on the transmission of the disease. We have formulated an SIR (susceptible-infected-recovered) model of the transmission of the disease which includes the effect of vaccination and used standard dynamical modelling methods to analyze the effects. The equilibrium states and their stabilities are investigated. The trajectories of the numerical solutions plotted into the 2D planes and 3D spaces are presented. The main contribution is determining the role of dengue vaccination in the model. From the analysis, we find that there is a significant reduction in the total hospitalization time needed to treat the illness.
