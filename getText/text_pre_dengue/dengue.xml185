Antibodies to Zika virus, 
The objective of this article was to study the presence of antibodies against Zika virus (ZIKV), Campylobacter jejuni, and gangliosides in patients with Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS).Ninety consecutive patients (age more than 12 years) with GBS admitted to a tertiary care center in southern India were included in this study. Data on clinical manifestations, nerve conduction studies, and response to therapy were collected. The following tests were done in stored serum samples - anti-ZIKV (IgM) antibodies, anti-C. jejuni (IgG) antibodies, and anti-ganglioside antibodies (IgG). Those samples which were positive to anti-Zika antibodies were tested for conventional polymerase chain reaction for ZIKV and IgM antibodies against dengue, and Japanese encephalitis virus.Of the 90 patients, 3 died and 8 had persistent weakness. Acute inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy was the most common type of GBS (56.7%). Anti-ganglioside antibodies were present in 62.2% patients with GT1b being the most common. Anti-C. jejuni antibodies were present in 46.6%. Anti-Zika antibodies (IgM) were present in 14 patients (15.5%). Four of these patients also had anti-dengue antibody (IgM) positivity.This is one of the largest studies on GBS from India and the first one to report on the presence of Zika virus antibodies from this geographical area. Our study had a high prevalence of anti-C. jejuni and anti-ganglioside antibodies. Evidence of recent ZIKV infection, as evidenced by anti-IgM antibodies, was present in 14 patients, with 4 of them being tested positive for anti-dengue IgM antibody. Whether this represents cross-reaction with dengue or prior/co-infection with dengue virus could not be addressed in this study.
