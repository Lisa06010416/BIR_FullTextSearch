Forecasting incidence of dengue and selecting best method for prevention.
This study forecast future infected patients from dengue and also sought optimum solution for its prevention. Previous years' data of dengue patients was used for forecasting numbers of infected patients in 2017. The novelty of the study is the application of Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) technique in application of dengue control. We employed AHP to rank the alternative for dengue prevention using perception of general public collected via questioners from 100 respondents across Pakistan. The results show that public considered not to let the water accumulate inside their homes as the most economical, effective, efficient and less labour intensive alternative to combat dengue.
