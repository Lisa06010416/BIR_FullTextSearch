Synergism between the tyrosine kinase inhibitor sunitinib and Anti-TNF antibody protects against lethal dengue infection.
Dengue virus (DENV) currently circulates in more than 100 countries and causes an estimated 390 million infections per year. While most cases manifest as a self-resolving fever, ∼1.5% of infections develop into a more severe dengue hemorrhagic fever/dengue shock syndrome (DHF/DSS), which causes ∼20,000 deaths annually. The underlying pathological feature of DHF/DSS, also known as Severe Dengue, is an acute increase in vascular permeability leading to hypovolemia and shock. Angiogenic factors and cytokines, such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF), have been implicated in the increased vascular permeability, suggesting a potential therapeutic strategy for Severe Dengue. Here, we employed a mouse model of antibody-dependent enhancement of DENV infection, which recapitulates the fatal capillary leakage and shock of human Severe Dengue, to investigate the effects of approved VEGF- and TNF-targeting drugs. DENV infection caused a significant increase in serum VEGF levels within 2 days and resulted in ∼80% mortality within 8 days of infection. Treatment of mice with sunitinib, a VEGF receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor, once (day 2) or twice (days 1 and 2) post-infection reduced mortality by 50-80% compared with untreated mice. Notably, sunitinib treatment decreased serum TNF levels, white blood cell counts, and hematocrit levels relative to untreated mice, but had only marginal effects on tissue viral burden. Combination therapy with anti-TNF antibody and sunitinib significantly reduced vascular leakage and synergized to provide superior protection from lethal DENV infection compared with either agent alone. These data suggest that a two-pronged anti-angiogenic and anti-inflammatory approach may be useful for the rapid treatment of DHF/DSS.
