Molecular Investigation of Dengue virus serotype 2 Circulation in Kassala State, Sudan.
The tropical nature of Sudan promotes the spread of mosquito-transmitted diseases such as dengue virus (DENV) infection. The current knowledge about the geographical distribution of DENV serotypes and genotypes in Sudan is limited. In this study, molecular techniques (Reverse Transcriptase -PCR and sequencing) followed by phylogenetic analysis were used to characterize DENV isolated from blood samples of suspected dengue patients admitted to Kassala Hospital, Kassala state, Sudan, in 2016/ 2017. We identified DENV infection in 4 patients by RT-PCR. Phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that the isolated virus sequences belong to the Cosmopolitan genotype of DENV serotype 2. This is the first study to confirm the presence of DENV serotype 2 in Kassala state, Sudan. This study urges the need for a wider investigation of the DENV serotypes composition and estimating their contribution to the ongoing transmission.
