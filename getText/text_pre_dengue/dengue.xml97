Different aspects of platelet evaluation in dengue: measurement of circulating mediators, ability to interact with the virus, the degree of activation and quantification of intraplatelet protein content.
Platelets play a role in hemostasis, coagulation, angiogenesis, inflammation and immune response is one of the most affected cells in dengue. Here we describe some aspects of platelets by observing their specific circulating mediators, the ability to interact with the virus and morphological consequences of this interaction, activation markers and intraplatelet protein contents in dengue. We conducted this study using dengue-patients as well as healthy donors. Immunoenzymatic assay, flow cytometry, transmission electron microscopy and intraplatelet proteins expression assays were carried out. Briefly, we found an increase in sCD62â€‰L, NO or TBX2 ratio in platelet count, mostly in patients with the worse clinical outcome. After in vitro DENV infection or during natural infection, platelets underwent morphological alteration with increased expression of platelet activation markers, particularly in natural infections. Analysis of intraplatelet protein contents revealed different angiogenic and inflammatory profiles, maintaining or not extracellular matrix integrity between DF and DFWS patients. Thus, platelets are frequently affected by dengue, either by altering their own functionality, as "carrier" of the virus, or as an antiviral and mediator-secreting effector cell. Thus, strategies aimed at recovering platelet amounts in dengue seem to be essential for a better clinical outcome of the patients.
