Relationship between local presence and density of Aedes aegypti eggs with dengue cases: a spatial analysis approach.
To analyze the relationship between the occurrence of dengue and ovitrap positivity and dengue egg density in two Amazonas municipalities (Brazil) in 2016.We performed a case-control study using secondary data from the dengue fever surveillance system. Ovitraps distributed regularly in the urban area of two cities were used to monitor the presence of the vector. The relationship between egg positivity, egg density and the location of dengue cases was evaluated using two approaches as follows: (i) based on the result of the nearest neighbour ovitrap and (ii) based on the results of the set of ovitraps within the influence area of 300 m from the location of each case and control.During the study period, 229 confirmed cases of dengue fever were reported in Tabatinga and 89 cases in Itacoatiara. In this study, we found that the positivity of ovitraps was related to the occurrence of dengue in Tabatinga and Itacoatiara. An association between egg density of Ae. aegypti and dengue occurrence was also observed in Itacoatiara. The temporal lags for ovitrap positivity measurements were predominantly 15 or 30 days. A dengue association for egg density for a 15-day time lag was detected for one of the case-control approaches.The location of dengue cases is related to ovitrap egg positivity, while a less evident possible association may exist for egg density. This indicates that these traps could be used to improve vector control actions.
