Human keratinocyte cultures (HaCaT) can be infected by DENV, triggering innate immune responses that include IFNλ and LL37.
The skin is the first anatomical region that dengue virus (DENV) encounters during the natural infection. Although the role of some skin resident cells like dendritic cells and fibroblasts has been demonstrated to be crucial to elucidate the role of resident cells and molecules participating during the early events of the innate immune response, the participation of keratinocytes during DENV infection has not been fully elucidated. In this paper we aimed to evaluate the use of the HaCaT cell line as a model to study the immune responses of skin keratinocytes to DENV infection. We demonstrated productive DENV-2 infection of HaCaT cells and their capability to establish an antiviral response through production of type I and type III interferons (IFN-β and IFN-λ). The production of these cytokines by HaCaT cells correlated with upregulation of IFN-inducible transmembrane protein-3 (IFITM3) and viperin in bystander, uninfected cells. We also observed an increase in secretion of IL-6 and IL-8. Skin keratinocytes are known to secrete antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) during viral infections. In our model, DENV-2 infected HaCaT cells upregulate the production of cytoplasmic LL-37. We evaluated the dual role of LL-37, HBD2, and HBD3 antiviral activity and immunoregulation during DENV-2 infection of HaCaT cells and found that LL-37 significantly reduced DENV-2 replication. This indicates that the HaCaT cell line can be used as a model for studying the innate response of keratinocytes to DENV infection. Our results also suggest that skin keratinocytes play an important role in the skin microenvironment after DENV infection by secreting molecules like type I and type III IFNs, pro-inflammatory molecules, and LL-37, which may contribute to the protection against arboviral infections.
