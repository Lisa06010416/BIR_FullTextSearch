Association of tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) gene polymorphisms (-308 G>A and -238 G>A) and the risk of severe dengue: A meta-analysis and trial sequential analysis.
Individual studies have assessed the association between TNF-α-308G>A and TNF-α-238 G>A polymorphisms and severity of dengue infection. However, the results are inconclusive and most studies had small sample sizes. The objective of this study was to summarize the evidence of association between TNF-α-308 G>A and TNF-α-238 G>A and severity of dengue infection. This study follows the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta- analyses of genetic association studies, recommended by PLOS One. We calculated pooled odds ratio and its 95% confidence interval (CI) to estimate the association between TNF-α-308 G>A or TNF-α-238 G>A and the risk of severe dengue infections. To determine the information size required for this meta-analysis study, a trial sequential analysis (TSA) was done. Eight studies (640 cases and 1275 controls), which assessed the association of TNF-α-308 G>A or TNF-α-238 G>A and the risk of DHF were included. Overall, we found no significant association between TNF-α-308 G>A and the DHF risk in the allelic model (OR, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.51-1.63), the recessive model (OR,1.32;95%CI,0.73-2.37), the dominant model (OR,0.93;95%CI:0.59-1.47) or the additive model (OR,1.43,95;95%CI:0.79-2.59). There was also no significant association between TNF-α-238 G>A and DHF risk under the allele contrast model (OR:1.51;95%CI:0.88-2.58), the recessive model (OR,1.48,95% CI:0.33-6.58), the dominant model (OR,1.48;95%CI:0.56-3.92), or the additive model (OR:1.5;95%CI:0.34-6.69). On subgroup analysis, neither the Asian population nor the non-Asian population showed significant association between TNF-α-308 G>A/TNF-α-238 G>A and the DHF risk under any genetic models. Leave-one-out meta-analysis showed stability of the results. TSA plots suggested that the sample size in this meta-analysis study was below the required information size. The findings suggest an inclusive evidence of the association between TNF-α-308/ TNF-α-238 G>A and the risk of developing severe dengue infection. Large studies with evidence of Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, assessing gene-gene interactions are recommended.
