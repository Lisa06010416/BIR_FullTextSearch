Impedimetric immunosensor for dengue diagnosis using graphite screen-printed electrodes coated with poly(4-aminophenylacetic acid).
Dengue is an infectious viral disease transmitted by the Aedes aegypti mosquito, the control of which is complex. In addition, the clinical diagnosis is difficult to perform since it resembles other febrile infections; thus, the development of more effective methods to detect dengue virus (DV) has drawn increasing attention. The present study aimed to develop an impedimetric immunosensor for dengue diagnosis using a screen-printed electrode (SPE) functionalized with polymer films derived from 4-aminophenylacetic acid (4-APA). Data obtained from scanning electron microscopy (SEM) showed the deposition of a uniformly distributed material over the electrode surface. The immunosensor was based on the specific interaction between dengue antigen, NS1 protein, and anti-NS1 antibodies, IgG and IgM. In a characterization study using cyclic voltammetry (CV), the polymer film showed two oxidation peaks at +0.17 and + 0.35 V in 0.50 M sulfuric acid solution, indicating its adsorption and electroactivity at the SPE surface. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements showed a higher charge transfer resistance (R
