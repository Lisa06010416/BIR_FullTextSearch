Impact of a Nonfatal Dengue Episode on Disability-Adjusted Life Years: A Systematic Analysis.
As dengue causes about 4,000 symptomatic nonfatal episodes for every dengue death globally, quantitative disability assessments are critical to assess the burden of dengue and the cost-effectiveness of dengue control interventions. This systematic analysis of disability or quality of life lost from a symptomatic nonfatal dengue episode combined a systematic literature review, statistical modeling, and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. We conceptualized a dengue episode as having two phases: acute and persistent symptoms. Our estimates for the acute phase, consisting of onset and recovery periods and defined as the first 20 days (0.054 year), were based on literature review. We searched PubMed, POPLINE, EconLit, Google Scholar, scientific conferences, and other sources, for "dengue" plus "quality of life" or related terms. From 4,322 initial entries, six met our criteria (original studies with empirical data). The median disability-adjusted life year (DALY) burden for the acute phase was 0.011 (95% certainty interval [CI]: 0.006-0.015) for ambulatory episodes, 0.015 (CI: 0.010-0.020) for hospitalized episodes, and 0.012 (CI: 0.006-0.019) overall. Using literature reviews about persistent dengue, we estimated that 34% of episodes experienced persistent symptoms with a median duration of symptoms of 0.087 (CI: 0.040-0.359) year, which resulted in median DALYs of 0.019 (CI: 0.008-0.082). Thus, the overall median DALY burden was 0.031 (CI: 0.017-0.092) for ambulatory episodes, 0.035 (CI: 0.024-0.096) for hospitalized episodes, and 0.032 (CI: 0.018-0.093) overall. Our dengue-specific burden of a dengue episode was 2.1 times the 2013 Global Burden of Disease estimate. These literature-based estimates provide an empirical summary for policy and cost-effectiveness analyses.
