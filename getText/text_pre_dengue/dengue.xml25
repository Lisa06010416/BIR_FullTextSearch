Validation of Serum Aminotransferases Levels to Define Severe Dengue Fever in Children.
We aimed to study the pattern of liver-injury in children with dengue fever (DF) and validate serum aminotransferase ≥1,000 IU/L as a marker of severe DF.Children admitted with DF were included. DF was defined by presence of clinical criteria and positive serological or antigen tests in absence of other etiology. DF severity was graded as dengue without or with warning signs and severe dengue. Liver-injury was defined as alanine aminotransferase (ALT) more than twice the upper limit of normal (boys, 30 IU/L; girls, 21 IU/L).Of 372 children with DF, 144 (38.7%) had liver-injury. Risk of liver-injury and aminotransferase levels increased with DF severity (Liver-injury is common in DF. The ALT and AST levels increase with DF severity. ALT and AST levels of ≥1,000 IU/L could be lowered to 376 IU/L and 635 IU/L respectively for defining severe DF.
