Emerging and imported diseases diagnosed in the emergency department of a hospital in Madrid.
To describe the clinical and epidemiologic characteristics of patients diagnosed with malaria, dengue fever, and Zika or chikungunya virus infections in a hospital emergency department. To describe the usefulness of the department's diagnostic resources.Descriptive observational study of patients diagnosed with infectious tropical diseases on the basis of samples collected in the emergency department.The department diagnosed 4 cases of dengue fever, 7 cases of Zika virus infection, 7 of malaria, and 2 concomitant infections (malaria plus dengue fever and malaria plus chikungunya infection).Most patients with these infections were males and natives of areas where the diseases were endemic. Even when malaria is diagnosed early, the possibility of concomitant infection by other arboviruses must be ruled out. Serology is necessary to rule out Zika virus infection; polymerase chain reaction testing of urine and serum should be included.
