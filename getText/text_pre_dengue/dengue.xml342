Mosquito-Borne Diseases.
Mosquito-borne diseases have become more common as previously geographically isolated diseases have spread globally. Chikungunya, dengue, Japanese encephalitis, malaria, West Nile, yellow fever, and Zika are a few of the common and emerging viral diseases spread by mosquitoes. A thorough patient history, physical, and knowledge of diagnostic testing based on symptom duration is important to make a quick and accurate diagnosis. Because the treatment for many of these diseases is supportive, the emphasis is on reducing risk and spread of infection.
