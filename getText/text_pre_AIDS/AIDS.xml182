Newly diagnosed AIDS with neurosyphilis, Kaposi sarcoma, pancytopenia, oropharyngeal candidiasis, and pseudomonal pneumonia: We shouldn't be seeing this anymore.
The incidence of new human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infections is declining and is half of what it was in the mid 1990s. We present a case of newly diagnosed HIV with acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), Neurosyphilis, Kaposi Sarcoma, and multiple opportunistic infections. Although this type of patient was not uncommon in the pre-antiretroviral era, we do not often see such a constellation of conditions in a single individual. The significance of this case lies not in the diagnosis, but rather in the number of the diagnoses and the thought process used to attain them.
