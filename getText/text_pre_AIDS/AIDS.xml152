Autoimmune blistering disorders in the setting of human immunodeficiency virus infection.
The interplay between immune dysfunction and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is complex. Reports of autoimmune disorders including autoimmune bullous disorders (AIBDs) have been increasing in prevalence in the HIV population since the introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy in 1995. We offer a literature review of clinical experiences in various AIBDs with particular emphasis on therapeutic management as well as a brief overview of the mechanisms that explain the relationship between AIBD and HIV. Because immunosuppressants are first-line therapies for AIBD treatment, careful consideration is warranted when considering management in the HIV population.
