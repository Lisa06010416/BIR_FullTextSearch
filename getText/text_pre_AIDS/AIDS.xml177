Adherence to antiretroviral therapy and correlation with adverse effects and coinfections in people living with HIV/AIDS in the municipality of Goiás State.
Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome is an advanced stage of a human immunodeficiency virus infection. The antiretroviral therapy aims to improve the life quality of HIV patients and a good adherence is essential for a better prognosis. This study aimed to evaluate the adherence of human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome patients to antiretroviral therapy recommended by the Brazilian health system in Anápolis/Goiás, and correlate the level of adherence with sociodemographic data and clinical-laboratory variables.Adherence to antiretroviral therapy was assessed using the Questionnaire for Evaluation of Adherence to Antiretroviral Therapy. The sociodemographic data were collected using a standardized questionnaire and the clinical-laboratory records were reviewed.Among 220 patients included, 59% (129/220) were men and the average age was 41 years. Infection was acquired primarily through sexual contact (92%, 202/220), and 69% (152/220) of the patients were heterosexual. Approximately 86% (188/220) of the patients had good or strict adherence to antiretroviral therapy. In our study, the use of illicit drugs was associated with low adherence to antiretroviral therapy (p=0.0004), and no significant association was observed between adherence levels and other sociodemographic data (p>0.05). The logistic regression indicated that adverse effects (p=0.0018) and sexual orientation (p=0.0152) were associated with the level of adherence to antiretroviral therapy. Patients with good or strict adherence had higher CD4+T lymphocyte count (p<0.0001) and undetectable viral load (p<0.0001). Patients with low adherence (14%, 32/220) had higher frequency of adverse events (p=0.0009). The frequency of coinfections was 25% (55/220), with syphilis and tuberculosis being the most common coinfections.Adherence was related to use of illicit drugs, adverse effects, and sexual orientation.
