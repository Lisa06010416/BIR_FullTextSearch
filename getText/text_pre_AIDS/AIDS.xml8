Immune-mediated acquired lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase deficiency: A case report and literature review.
Recessive inherited disorder lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) deficiency causes severe hypocholesterolemia and nephrotic syndrome. Characteristic lipoprotein subfractions have been observed in familial LCAT deficiency (FLD) with renal damage.We described a case of acquired LCAT deficiencies with literature review.The lipoprotein profiles examined by gel permeation-high-performance liquid chromatography (GP-HPLC) and native 2-dimensional electrophoresis before and after prednisolone (PSL) treatment.Here we describe the case of a 67-year-old man with severely low levels of cholesterol. The serum LCAT activity was undetectable, and autoantibodies against it were detected. The patient developed nephrotic syndrome at the age of 70 years. Renal biopsy revealed not only membranous glomerulonephritis but also lesions similar to those seen in FLD. We initiated PSL treatment, which resulted in remission of the nephrotic syndrome. In GP-HPLC analysis, lipoprotein profile was similar to that of FLD although lipoprotein X level was low. Acquired LCAT deficiencies are extremely rare with only 7 known cases including ours. Patients with undetectable LCAT activity levels develop nephrotic syndrome that requires PSL treatment; cases whose LCAT activity levels can be determined may also develop nephrotic syndrome, but spontaneously recover.Lipoprotein X may play a role in the development of renal impairment in individuals with FLD. However, the effect might be less significant in individuals with acquired LCAT deficiency.
