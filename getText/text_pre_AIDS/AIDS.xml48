A 30-year journey of trial and error towards a tolerogenic AIDS vaccine.
Since 1985, we have tested several immunological approaches to suppressing HIV replication in HIV-infected patients and to prevent HIV acquisition in uninfected people. Here, after briefly reviewing our studies on immunosuppressive treatments and therapeutic dendritic cell-based therapies, we examine in more detail our work on the tolerogenic vaccines we developed against AIDS in Chinese macaques. The vaccine consisted of inactivated SIVmac239 particles adjuvanted with the Bacillus of Calmette and Guerin (BCG), Lactobacillus plantarum (LP), or Lactobacillus rhamnosus (LR). Without adjuvant, the vaccine administered by the intragastric route induced the usual simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV)-specific humoral immune responses but no post-challenge protection. In contrast, out of 24 macaques that were immunized with the adjuvanted vaccine and challenged intrarectally with SIVmac239 or SIVB670, 23 were sterilely protected for up to 5Â years, while all control macaques were infected. On the other hand, all macaques of Indian origin that were immunized with the same adjuvanted vaccine were not protected. We then discovered that vaccinated Chinese macaques developed a previously unrecognized class of non-cytolytic MHC-Ib/E-restricted CD8  T cells (or CD8  T-Regs) that suppressed the activation of SIV RNA-infected CD4  T cells and thereby inhibited the (activation-dependent) reverse transcription of the virus and prevented the establishment of SIV infection. Finally, we found a similar population of HLA-E-restricted CD8  T-Regs in human elite controllers (a small group of HIV-infected patients whose viral replication is naturally inhibited). Ex vivo, their CD8  T-Regs suppressed viral replication in the same manner as those of vaccinated Chinese macaques. It is noteworthy that all of these elite controllers had a homo- or heterozygous HLA-Bw4-80I genotype. Taking into account the longevity and the high percentage of vaccine-protected Chinese macaques together with the concomitant identification of a robust ex vivo correlate of protection and the discovery of similar CD8  T-Regs in human elite controllers, preventive and therapeutic HIV vaccines should be envisaged in humans.
