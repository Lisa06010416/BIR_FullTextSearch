Strategies on Nanodiagnostics and Nanotherapies of the Three Common Cancers.
The emergence of nanomedicine has enriched the knowledge and strategies of treating diseases, and especially some incurable diseases, such as cancers, acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), and neurodegenerative diseases. The application of nanoparticles in medicine is in the core of nanomedicine. Nanoparticles can be used in drug delivery for improving the uptake of poorly soluble drugs, targeted delivery to a specific site, and drug bioavailability. Early diagnosis of and targeted therapies for cancers can significantly improve patients' quality of life and extend patients' lives. The advantages of nanoparticles have given them a progressively important role in the nanodiagnosis and nanotherapy of common cancers. To provide a reference for the further application of nanoparticles, this review focuses on the recent development and application of nanoparticles in the early diagnosis and treatment of the three common cancers (lung cancer, liver cancer, and breast cancer) by using quantum dots, magnetic nanoparticles, and gold nanoparticles.
