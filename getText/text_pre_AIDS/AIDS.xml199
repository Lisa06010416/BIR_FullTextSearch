[Prevalence and risk factors associated to tuberculosis and non-tuberculous mycobacterial infections in HIV-positive patients in Bogotá].
Tuberculosis is one of the most widely distributed infectious diseases worldwide. It is the most common cause of mortality among AIDS patients. In Colombia, 12,918 tuberculosis cases were notified, and 926 deaths were reported in 2015.To determine the prevalence and risk factors associated to mycobacterial infections in HIVpositive patients in two public hospitals from Bogotá.A prospective and descriptive study was carried out by an active search for tuberculosis cases and non-tuberculous mycobacterial infections in HIV-positive patients. We considered demographic, social, clinical, and personal habits as variables. Statistical analyses were done using Stata 13™ software.Three hundred and fifty six patients were included, 81.2% were men and 18.8% were women; the mean age was 36.5 years. Tuberculosis infection had a frequency of 19.9% (95% CI: 15.9-24.5%) and non-tuberculous mycobacterial infection had a 3.9% frequency (95% CI: 2.16-6.5%). Bivariate analysis showed a statistically significant association between tuberculosis infection and CD4+ T cell counts (p=0.003), viral load (p=0.008), antiretroviral therapy (p=0.014), and body mass index (BMI) <18 kg/m2 (p=0.000). In non-tuberculous mycobacterial infections there was a statistically significantassociation with BMI (p=0.027) and CD4+ T cell counts (p=0.045).Factors associated with an impaired immune system caused by HIV infection are an important risk factor for developing tuberculosis. The lack of antiretroviral therapy and the BMI were also important risk factors for tuberculosis.
