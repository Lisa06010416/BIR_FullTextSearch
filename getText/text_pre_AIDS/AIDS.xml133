Exploring and prioritization of mobile-based self-management strategies for HIV care.
Appropriate mobile-based self-management strategies can be as new approaches to decelerate the HIV infection progression and improve quality of life. This study aims at (i) identifying in the literature mobile-based self-management strategies for HIV care and (ii) prioritizing those from the point of view of infectious diseases specialists. This study provides some clues to design useful mobile-based self-management tools for HIV patients, from the point of view of practitioners.This mixed methods study was done in two main phases. In the first phase, a review was conducted in: PubMed, Web of Science, Science direct, Scopus, and Ovid. In this manner, related studies published between 2010 and 2017 and in the English language were reviewed. In the second phase, identified mobile-based self-management strategies were scored and prioritized by 23 participants. Frequency distribution and mean reports were calculated using SPSS statistical software.By detailed reviewing of 24 related articles, the HIV mobile-based self-management strategies were identified in 47 categories and subcategories. According to the findings, "enhance the quality of life" was the main self-management strategy addressed by reviewed studies. However, "antiretroviral therapy and medication adherence" was reported at a higher rate to be a more helpful strategy than "enhance the quality of life".In this study, helpful HIV mobile-based self-management strategies were identified that can be used to guide self-management interventions which have the potential to improve the healthcare services for people living with HIV.
