Decreased Lung Function and All-Cause Mortality in HIV-infected Individuals.
Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection is associated with pulmonary disease and worse lung function, but the relationship of lung function with survival in HIV is unknown.To determine whether lung function is associated with all-cause mortality in HIV-infected individuals.HIV-infected participants from cohorts in three locations underwent pre- and post-bronchodilator spirometry and determination of single-breath diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (DlOverall, 396 HIV-infected participants underwent pulmonary function testing. Thirty-two participants (8%) died during a median follow-up period of 69 months. A post-bronchodilator FEVAirflow obstruction and impaired diffusing capacity appear to be associated with all-cause mortality in HIV-infected persons over an average of 6 years of follow-up. These data highlight the importance of lung dysfunction in HIV-infected persons and should be confirmed in larger cohorts and with extended follow-up periods.
