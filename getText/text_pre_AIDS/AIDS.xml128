Skills and Core Competencies of Pharmacists in Humanitarian Assistance.
Pharmacists' participation in health care within multi-disciplinary teams in Humanitarian Assistance (HA) shall be encouraged. Limited literature exists on their role in the humanitarian context. The objective of this paper is to evidence the skill-specific, comprehensive core competencies that pharmacists must demonstrate working in humanitarian interventions.The literature search laid the groundwork for the development of interview guides and further analysis of the data. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with expatriate pharmacists and medical coordinators, all of whom have worked in the field of HA. The interviews were recorded, transcribed, and analyzed using a content analysis methodology.Three pharmacists and three medical coordinators were interviewed, who had worked in a combined 32 humanitarian missions. The main functions of pharmacists were focused on stock management and supply of medicinal products. However, pharmacists in HA did not perform many functions related to the provision of effective medication therapy management (MTM). A core competency framework for pharmacists working in the humanitarian field was created, which reflects the personal and technical competencies that are essential to work in HA.Self-management in a pressured and changing environment, the ability to adapt to changing situations, and planning, prioritizing, and performing tasks well under pressure are the skills required for pharmacists and for any other humanitarian health worker. The results highlight great efforts being dedicated to pharmaceutical product supply and management by pharmacists working in HA. VardanyanH, MoseguiGBG, MirandaES.
