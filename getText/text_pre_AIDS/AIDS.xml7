Insurance status and mortality among patients with AIDS.
The aim of the study was to evaluate risk factors for mortality, including health care insurance status, among patients with AIDS in the era of modern combination antiretroviral therapy (cART).This study was part of the prospective, multicentre, observational Longitudinal Study of the Ocular Complications of AIDS (LSOCA). Patients were classified as having private health care insurance, Medicare, Medicaid, or no insurance. Hazard ratios (HRs) for death were calculated using proportional hazards regression models and staggered entries, anchored to the AIDS diagnosis date.Among 2363 participants with AIDS, 97% were treated with cART. At enrolment, 31% of participants had private insurance, 29% had Medicare, 24% had Medicaid, and 16% were uninsured. Noninfectious, age-related diseases, such as hypertension, diabetes, and renal disease, were more frequent among persons with Medicare than among those with private insurance. Compared with those who were privately insured, mortality was greater among participants with Medicare [adjusted HR (HRIn persons with AIDS, compared with those with private insurance, those with public insurance had increased mortality, possibly as a result of a greater burden of noninfectious, age-related diseases.
