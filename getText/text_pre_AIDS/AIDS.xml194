Psychometric properties of the Korean version of the medical outcomes study HIV health survey: results from a multicenter survey in Korea.
Precise assessment of health-related quality of life (HRQOL) with a reliable and valid measure is a prerequisite to the enhancement of HRQOL. This study examined the psychometric properties of the Korean version of the Medical Outcomes Study HIV Health Survey (K-MOS-HIV).The reliability and validity of the K-MOS-HIV were examined in a multicenter survey involving 201 outpatients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/ acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) from four teaching hospitals throughout Korea.Ceiling effects were observed in six subscales scores, particularly, for the role functioning (71.1%), social functioning (63.2%), and pain (48.8%) scores. The Cronbach's Î± for the physical health summary and mental health summary were 0.90 and 0.94, respectively, and it ranged from 0.78 to 0.95 for the subscales. The results of the exploratory structural equation modeling supported the two-factor structure of the K-MOS-HIV (physical health summary and mental health summary). An examination of the mean square statistics values from the Rasch analysis showed that the information-weighted fit and outlier-sensitive fit statistics were within the acceptable ranges of 0.6-1.4 except for two items in the mental health summary. The convergent validity of the K-MOS-HIV was supported by its significant positive correlations with the World Health Organization Quality of Life-HIV-BREF subscale scores. Its known-group validity was proven with its ability to detect significant differences in several K-MOS-HIV subscale scores among participants with different sociodemographic and clinical characteristics.The K-MOS-HIV health survey appears to be a reliable and valid measure of HRQOL.
