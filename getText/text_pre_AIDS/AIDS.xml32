The application of L-PRP in AIDS patients with crural chronic ulcers: A pilot study.
Nonhealing wounds or skin ulcerations are the result of insufficient repair and destruction of a local healing potential. Opportunistic infections which cause a lot of ulcer complications influence the worsening general condition of patients with AIDS, ultimately leading to death. The chronicity of the condition and poor results of conventional therapy have prompted the search for new methods of treatment.We have examined venous or arteriovenous insufficiency-related extensive crural ulcers in AIDS patients. Crural ulcer healing processes were evaluated with clinical observations and histopathological, immunohistochemical and molecular examinations of tissue samples harvested from the wound edges before and on day 10 after L-PRP cover dressing.Clinical observations showed positive effects of L-PRP in all patients. However, complete wound closure was noted in 60% of cases. Statistical analysis of histological examination showed increased epidermal processes between samples, but the difference was nonsignificant. However, immunohistochemical investigations showed an increased healing process with strong statistical significance. The mean VEGF level before L-PRP usage was 114.3 vessels/mm  and on day 10 118.9 (p=0.001523). The mean FLK level was 103.2 and 109.9 respectively (p=0.008241). The biggest differences were observed for CD34, with values of 68.2 on day 0 and 100.8 on day 10 (p=0.006982). Molecular analysis generally showed decreased gene expression and confirmed vascular formation and reepithelialization processes.In our opinion, L-PRP may be used to eradicate microorganisms from wounds, to induce neovascularization, and in unhealed cases prepare the base and edge of the ulcer for skin grafting and tissue expansion procedures.
