Common Gastrointestinal Complications Associated with Human Immunodeficiency Virus/AIDS: An Overview.
Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has transformed human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/AIDS into a manageable chronic illness. People living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) can experience multiple physical symptoms or problems related to HIV infection and treatment. A common problem for PLWHA continues to be diarrhea and nausea and vomiting (NV). Diarrhea and NV can negatively impact the quality of life and adherence to medication therapy among PLWHA and are common reasons to change or discontinue HAART regimens. Because diarrhea and NV can have substantial negative health outcomes for PLWHA, it is important to understand the causes of these conditions.
