Mini Review - Epigenetics: Quest for no-escape to HIV, a persistent pathogen.
Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) is a disease infection mix, which is primarily because of 'deficient' immune system. Human Immune-deficiency Virus (HIV) makes the immune system susceptible to many infections by infiltrating it. Many researchers believe that HIV is a mutated form of Simian Immune-deficiency Virus (SIV). After being clinically discovered in 1981 in America, it is said to have caused 36 million deaths. Treatment of AIDS has been a 'burning ' issue ever since its discovery. There is no cure for AIDS! Although, Recombinant Transcriptase Inhibitors (RTis) are being considered a major treatment against HIV that can not only lessen the effect of HIV but also can prolong the life of HIV positive patients. More recent advancement includes 'transplantation of transgenic stem cells' in HIV positive patients. As latency of HIV provirus in host genome is the preeminent weapon of this virus against RTis that compel it to hide from host immune system and a persistent pathogen thereof. Thus, epigenetic activation of latent provirus pool by methyl inhibitors along with nonÂ¬toxic chemical drugs seems to be a more promising treatment to avoid the burden of lifelong RTI.
