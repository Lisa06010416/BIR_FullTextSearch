Nodular granulomatous Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia consequent to delayed immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome.
Although Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia (PCP) is a frequent manifestation of acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), the granulomatous form is uncommon. Here, we present an unusual case of granulomatous PCP consequent to immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) after highly active antiretroviral therapy. A 36-year-old woman with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) presented with cough and dyspnea that were attributed to typical PCP associated with AIDS. She was successfully treated with antibiotic, steroid, and antiretroviral therapies. After six months, however, she presented with consolidating lung lesions caused by bronchial obstruction from PCP granulomatous disease. Although antibiotics were ineffective, the effectiveness of steroid therapy suggested a diagnosis of granulomatous IRIS caused by persistent PCP antigens. Physicians should strongly suspect PCP in HIV-positive patients with nodular lung lesions and must remain aware that these lesions, if immune in origin, might not respond to antimicrobial therapy.
