[Radiotherapy for HIV-infected patients].
Since the advent of highly active antiretroviral therapy, cancer incidence is still 2 to 3-fold higher in patients infected by human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) than in the general population, with an increased incidence of malignancies not associated with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). HIV-infected patients cancer treatment does not differ from that in the general population. However, the management of those patients have some particularities due to preexisting comorbid conditions, including metabolic, cardiovascular, renal or hepatic complications and the risk for potential drug - drug interactions in HIV-infected patients. In this review, we described efficacy and tolerance of radiotherapy with or without chemotherapy in this frail population treated for cancer. Utilization of modern radiotherapy techniques such as intensity-modulated radiotherapy may improve the treatment tolerance.
