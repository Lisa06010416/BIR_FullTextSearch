Acquired Pure Red Cell Aplasia and Acquired Amegakaryocytic Thrombocytopenia Associated With Clonal Expansion of T-Cell Large Granular Lymphocytes in a Patient With Lipopolysaccharide-responsive Beige-like Anchor (LRBA) Protein Deficiency.
Acquired pure red cell aplasia and acquired amegakaryocytic thrombocytopenic purpura are rare in children. Similarly, clonal expansion of T-cell large granular lymphocytes is infrequently seen in pediatrics. Lipopolysaccharide-responsive beige-like anchor (LRBA) protein deficiency is a recently described immunodeficiency syndrome that has been associated with inflammatory bowel disease and autoimmune phenomena such as Evans syndrome. Here, we describe a patient with LRBA deficiency who developed acquired pure red cell aplasia and acquired amegakaryocytic thrombocytopenic purpura associated with expansion of clonal T-cell large granular lymphocytes. This has not been described in the literature previously and adds to the knowledge on the spectrum of manifestations of LRBA deficiency.
