Adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome - CD4+ T-cell malignancy in CD4+ T-cell deficient status: A paradox.
CD4 counts along with viral loads are important parameters in the monitoring of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Human T-cell lymphotropic virus type I (HTLV-I) is known to be an etiological agent for adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL). Coinfection of HTLV-I and HIV is well known in regions with high seroprevalence, and there is no published data in the Indian scenario. We present an interesting case of occurrence of CD4+ T-cell proliferation in a known beta thalassemia major with acquired HIV seropositivity accompanied by simultaneously increasing CD4+ counts and viral loads. Further workup revealed ATLL with an underlying HTLV infection.
