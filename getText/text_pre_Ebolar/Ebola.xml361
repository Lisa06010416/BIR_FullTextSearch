[Insufficient Preparation of Ambulatory Physicians for Ebola Virus Disease in Germany].
Globalization and climate change increase the likelihood of a global spread of high consequence infectious diseases.We analyzed how outpatient physicians in Germany were prepared to recognize and handle potential Ebola virus-infected patients during the recent Ebola outbreak in West Africa.Outpatient physicians participated in 2 anonymous surveys (n=166 and 129, respectively) and were asked, among others, about their knowledge of Ebola virus disease, their subjective perception of their own knowledge and the practical implementation in their daily routine. This was compared to a minimum standard defined by 14 members of the German "Permanent Working Group of Competence and Treatment Centres for high consequence infectious diseases" (STAKOB).The Ebola virus-specific knowledge of participants was significantly inferior compared to the defined minimum standard. Of 8 factual questions, an average of merely 5 was answered correctly. The physicians' subjective perception of knowledge presented as 'little'. Although 56% of participants indicated that they had received standard operation procedures, 64% had not implemented them into their daily routine. Merely 22% of surveyed medical doctors participated in Ebola virus-specific education programs. Yet participation led to a significantly better subjective knowledge perception.Contrary to the official assessment that Germany is well prepared for high consequence infectious diseases, this study suggests that there are deficits in this area. Despite the abundance of information about Ebola virus disease, preparation of outpatient physicians in Germany was inadequate. Yet nearly half of the participants indicated the potential risk of occurrence as 'likely' or 'very likely'. The presented data show the different consequences to be drawn regarding potential future crises and further research.
