Knowledge, attitude and practice of medical laboratory practitioners in the fight against Ebola virus disease.
Ebola virus disease (EVD) in West Africa was an enormous public health challenge. Nigeria was able to contain the spread of the virus with a concerted effort and an effective public health response in terms of identification of contacts, rapid laboratory diagnosis, quarantine and symptomatic treatment. We determined the knowledge, attitude and practice of medical laboratory practitioners (MLPs) in this post-Ebola epidemic era.This cross-sectional study was carried out in eight hospitals in Kano State for 6 months, between January and June 2016. It involved medical laboratory scientists (MLS), medical laboratory technicians (MLT) and medical laboratory assistants (MLA). Questionnaires were administered and analysed.Of the 75 participants, mean knowledge score was 5.54 (standard deviation [SD] ±1.44) while the mean attitude score was 13.72 ±2.80, and mean practice score was 3.10 ±0.80. Mean age of participants was 36.82 ± 8.07 years. There was full awareness of EVD among all 75 participants; however, many medical laboratory practitioners (52.7%) did not know EVD prevention methods. The majority (86.1%) knew the source of disease outbreak and most MLPs (66.7%) practised improper hand washing to prevent Ebola transmission. In addition, they had a negative attitude and practice towards EVD. Of 71 MLPs, 52 (73.2%) strongly disagreed that a traditional remedy was preferable in EVD treatment.Fear of EVD among MLPs has declined.
