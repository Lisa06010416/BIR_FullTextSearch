How myeloid cells contribute to the pathogenesis of prominent emerging zoonotic diseases.
Up to 75 % of emerging human diseases are zoonoses, spread from animals to humans. Although bacteria, fungi and parasites can be causative agents, the majority of zoonotic infections are caused by viral pathogens. During the past 20 years many factors have converged to cause a dramatic resurgence or emergence of zoonotic diseases. Some of these factors include demographics, social changes, urban sprawl, changes in agricultural practices and global climate changes. In the period between 2014-2017 zoonotic viruses including ebola virus (EBOV), chikungunya virus (CHIKV), dengue virus (DENV) and zika virus (ZIKV), caused prominent outbreaks resulting in significant public health and economic burdens, especially in developing areas where these diseases are most prevalent. When a viral pathogen invades a new human host, it is the innate immune system that serves as the first line of defence. Myeloid cells are especially important to help fight viral infections, including those of zoonotic origins. However, viruses such as EBOV, CHIKV, DENV and ZIKV have evolved mechanisms that allow circumvention of the host's innate immune response, avoiding eradication and leading to severe clinical disease. Herein, the importance of myeloid cells in host defence is discussed and the mechanisms by which these viruses exploit myeloid cells are highlighted. The insights provided in this review will be invaluable for future studies looking to identify potential therapeutic targets towards the treatment of these emerging diseases.
