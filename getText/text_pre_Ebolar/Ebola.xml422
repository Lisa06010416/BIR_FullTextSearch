A GXXXA Motif in the Transmembrane Domain of the Ebola Virus Glycoprotein Is Required for Tetherin Antagonism.
The interferon-induced antiviral host cell protein tetherin can inhibit the release of several enveloped viruses from infected cells. The Ebola virus (EBOV) glycoprotein (GP) antagonizes tetherin, but the domains and amino acids in GP that are required for tetherin antagonism have not been fully defined. A GXXXA motif within the transmembrane domain (TMD) of EBOV-GP was previously shown to be important for GP-mediated cellular detachment. Here, we investigated whether this motif also contributes to tetherin antagonism. Mutation of the GXXXA motif did not impact GP expression or particle incorporation and only modestly reduced EBOV-GP-driven entry. In contrast, the GXXXA motif was required for tetherin antagonism in transfected cells. Moreover, alteration of the GXXXA motif increased tetherin sensitivity of a replication-competent vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) chimera encoding EBOV-GP. Although these results await confirmation with authentic EBOV, they indicate that a GXXXA motif in the TMD of EBOV-GP is important for tetherin antagonism. Moreover, they provide the first evidence that GP can antagonize tetherin in the context of an infectious EBOV surrogate.
