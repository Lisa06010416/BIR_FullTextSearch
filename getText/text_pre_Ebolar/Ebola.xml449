Preparation needed for the social dimensions of epidemics in Africa: Experience from a training session in Conakry.
After the Ebola outbreak in West Africa (2013-2016), preparedness is on the agenda of health institutions. However, key questions remain about the scope of preparedness and activities related to the socio-cultural dimension of epidemics. A multidisciplinary short-course Infectious Diseases and Anthropology in West Africa (MIAA) was held at CERFIG, Conakry, in November 2017. Its evaluation provides some answers to key questions, such as who should be trained, and what its objectives, pedagogical contents, and methods should be.
