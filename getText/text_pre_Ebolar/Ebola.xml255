A Replicating Single-cycle Adenovirus Vaccine against Ebola Virus.
Recent West African Ebola virus (EBOV) epidemics have led to testing different anti-EBOV vaccines including a replication-defective adenovirus (RD-Ad) vector, ChAd3-EBOV, and an infectious, replication-competent vesicular stomatitis virus expressing the EBOV glycoprotein (rVSV-EBOV, also known as rVSV-ZEBOV). While RD-Ads elicit protection, they may suffer in comparison to vaccines that can replicate when scaled up to human trials. Though a replication-competent Ad (RC-Ad) vaccine might be a more equal comparator to rVSV, this infectious vector would also risk causing adenovirus disease. We recently described a "single cycle" adenovirus (SC-Ad) vector that amplifies antigen genes like RC-Ad, but that avoids the risk of adenovirus infection. Here we have tested an SC-Ad6 vector expressing the glycoprotein from a 2014 EBOV strain in mice, hamsters, and rhesus macaques. We show that SC-Ad6-EBOV gp induces high serum antibodies in all species and mediates significant protection against pseudo-challenge with rVSV-EBOV expressing luciferase in mice and hamsters. These data suggest that SC-Ad6-EBOV gp may have utility during future EBOV outbreaks.
