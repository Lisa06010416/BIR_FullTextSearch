Dengue virus not detected in human semen.
Zika and Ebola viruses can persist in semen and pose a risk for sexual transmission. To determine if dengue virus, another flavivirus, is similarly detectable in semen, we performed dengue PCR on semen in five patients with acute dengue virus infection. All five tested negative, suggesting that dengue does not pose a risk for sexual transmission.
