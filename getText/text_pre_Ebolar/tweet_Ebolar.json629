So happy to have met Rtd Major Gen Jeremy Rowan at @ UKParliament today. Jeremy led the UK armyâ€™s response to the Ebola crisis in # SierraLeone. He spoke so passionately about Sierra Leoneans and how touched he was by our collective fortitude during the crisis. Bless him. pic.twitter.com/MHP6BUihi0
