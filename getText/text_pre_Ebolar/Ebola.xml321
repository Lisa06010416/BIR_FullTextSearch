Ebola Virus Infection in Commonly Used Laboratory Mouse Strains.
The mouse model for Ebola virus (EBOV) is an established and often used animal model for countermeasure development. Although it has its limitations, it recapitulates certain key features of human EBOV disease and principally shows uniform lethality. However, in the recent past, several studies reported surviving animals when evaluating treatment or vaccine approaches. Therefore, we analyzed the severity of disease and lethality of mouse-adapted (MA-) EBOV infection in 6 different mouse strains. We identified outbred CD-1 mice to be the only strain tested resulting in uniform lethality when infected with different doses of MA-EBOV or reverse genetics-generated MA-EBOV. In contrast, infection of different inbred mouse strains resulted in partial survival depending on virus and dose. Of these inbred strains, 129 mice provided the most consistent model. Our study provides a helpful dataset when planning EBOV mouse studies for countermeasure efficacy testing and highlights the limitations of certain mouse strains as EBOV models.
