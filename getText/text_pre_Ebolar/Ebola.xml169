Long-Range Polymerase Chain Reaction Method for Sequencing the Ebola Virus Genome From Ecological and Clinical Samples.
Sequencing viral genomes during an outbreak can facilitate response and containment efforts. In this study, we describe a reverse transcription long-range polymerase chain reaction for efficient amplification and sequencing of the Ebola virus (EBOV) genome in 2 seminested reactions. We demonstrate that our method remains robust with complex biological samples by amplifying and sequencing the EBOV genome from EBOV-infected nonhuman primates (NHPs). We further demonstrate that we are able to recover viral genomes from starting concentrations as low as 103 50% tissue culture infective dose (TCID50)/mL, suggesting that this method can be employed to sequence EBOV genomes from ecologically or clinically derived samples.
