The Effect of Plasmodium on the Outcome of Ebola Virus Infection in a Mouse Model.
Following the Ebola virus epidemic in West Africa, several studies investigated whether there was an effect of Plasmodium coinfection on survival in Ebola virus (EBOV) disease patients. Different effects of coinfection were found in different patient cohorts. To determine whether an effect of Plasmodium coinfection on EBOV survival may exist, we modeled coinfection of Plasmodium yoelii and mouse-adapted EBOV (MA-EBOV) in CD1 mice. Subsequent infection with MA-EBOV at different time points after P. yoelii infection did not have any significant effect on survival.
