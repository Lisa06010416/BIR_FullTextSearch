Protein Phosphatase 1α Interacts with Venezuelan Equine Encephalitis Virus Capsid Protein and Regulates Viral Replication through Modulation of Capsid Phosphorylation.
Protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) is a serine/threonine phosphatase which has been implicated in the regulation of a number of viruses, including HIV-1, Ebolavirus, and Rift Valley fever virus. Catalytic subunits of PP1 (PP1α, PP1β, and PP1γ) interact with a host of regulatory subunits and target a wide variety of cellular substrates through a combination of short binding motifs, including an RVxF motif present in the majority of PP1 regulatory subunits. Targeting the RVxF-interacting site on PP1 with the small molecule 1E7-03 inhibits HIV-1, Ebolavirus, and Rift Valley fever virus replication. In this study, we determined the effect of PP1 on Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV) replication. Treatment of VEEV-infected cells with 1E7-03 decreased viral replication by more than 2 logs (50% effective concentration [EC
