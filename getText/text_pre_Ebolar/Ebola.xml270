Optimization of Isothiazolo[4,3- b]pyridine-Based Inhibitors of Cyclin G Associated Kinase (GAK) with Broad-Spectrum Antiviral Activity.
There is an urgent need for strategies to combat dengue and other emerging viral infections. We reported that cyclin G-associated kinase (GAK), a cellular regulator of the clathrin-associated host adaptor proteins AP-1 and AP-2, regulates intracellular trafficking of multiple unrelated RNA viruses during early and late stages of the viral lifecycle. We also reported the discovery of potent, selective GAK inhibitors based on an isothiazolo[4,3- b]pyridine scaffold, albeit with moderate antiviral activity. Here, we describe our efforts leading to the discovery of novel isothiazolo[4,3- b]pyridines that maintain high GAK affinity and selectivity. These compounds demonstrate improved in vitro activity against dengue virus, including in human primary dendritic cells, and efficacy against the unrelated Ebola and chikungunya viruses. Moreover, inhibition of GAK activity was validated as an important mechanism of antiviral action of these compounds. These findings demonstrate the potential utility of a GAK-targeted broad-spectrum approach for combating currently untreatable emerging viral infections.
