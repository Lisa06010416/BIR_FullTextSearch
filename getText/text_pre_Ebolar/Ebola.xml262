Ebola virus disease: assessment of knowledge, attitude and practice of nursing students of a Nigerian University.
Ebola virus disease has a high case fatality rate. Health care providers have a key role to play in its management and prevention.The aim of this study was to determine the knowledge, attitude and practice regarding Ebola virus disease (EVD) among students of Nursing in the University of Calabar, Calabar, Nigeria.This was a descriptive cross-sectional study. A semi-structured,self-administered questionnaire was administered to 178 nursing students. The respondents were selected using systematic random sampling.Lecturers were the commonest source of information regarding EVD as reported by 84.5% of the respondents followed by television (76.3%). Nearly 27% of respondents indicated that the fear of EVD had dampened their interest and enthusiasm in the nursing profession. Nearly 12 % indicated that they would not take part as theatre nurses in the surgical operation of a patient who had been certified cured of EVD. A similar proportion indicated their unwillingness to attend to a woman in labour even if she had been certified cured of EVD.Majority of the students were knowledgeable about EVD. Although majority of them had favorable attitude towards EVD patients, there was evidence of stigmatizing and discriminatory attitude that needs to be addressed.
