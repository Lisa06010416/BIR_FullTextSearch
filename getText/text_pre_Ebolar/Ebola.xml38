Identification of Myricetin as an Ebola Virus VP35-Double-Stranded RNA Interaction Inhibitor through a Novel Fluorescence-Based Assay.
Ebola virus (EBOV) is a filovirus that causes a severe and rapidly progressing hemorrhagic syndrome; a recent epidemic illustrated the urgent need for novel therapeutic agents because no drugs have been approved for treatment of Ebola virus. A key contribution to the high lethality observed during EBOV outbreaks comes from viral evasion of the host antiviral innate immune response in which viral protein VP35 plays a crucial role, blocking interferon type I production, first by masking the viral double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) and preventing its detection by the pattern recognition receptor RIG-I. Aiming to identify inhibitors of the interaction of VP35 with the viral dsRNA, counteracting the VP35 viral innate immune evasion, we established a new methodology for high-yield recombinant VP35 (rVP35) expression and purification and a novel and robust fluorescence-based rVP35-RNA interaction assay ( Z' factor of 0.69). Taking advantage of such newly established methods, we screened a small library of Sardinian natural extracts, identifying Limonium morisianum as the most potent inhibitor extract. A bioguided fractionation led to the identification of myricetin as the component that can inhibit rVP35-dsRNA interaction with an IC
