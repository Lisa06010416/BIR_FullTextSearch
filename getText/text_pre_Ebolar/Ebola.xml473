Unconventional secretion of viral proteins.
Although largely less numerous and characterized than bacterial secreted effectors, several viral virulence factors are secreted by virus infected cells. However, their mode of secretion only starts to be studied at the molecular level. Several of these viral effectors are secreted using an unconventional secretion pathway, i.e. despite the lack of signal sequence. We here review recent results illustrating the diversity of these pathways. In the case of HIV-1 proteins Tat and matrix (p17) proteins, secretion directly takes place at the plasma membrane level following binding to PI(4,5)P
