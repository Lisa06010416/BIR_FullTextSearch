Development of clinical-stage human monoclonal antibodies that treat advanced Ebola virus disease in non-human primates.
For most classes of drugs rapid development of therapeutics to treat emerging infections is challenged by the timelines needed to identify compounds with the desired efficacy, safety and PK profiles. Fully human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) provide an attractive method to overcome many of these hurdles to rapidly produce therapeutics for emerging diseases.Here we deployed a platform to generate, test and develop fully human antibodies to Zaire ebolavirus. We obtained specific anti-EBOV antibodies by immunizing VelocImmune® mice that use human Ig variable regions in their humoral responses.Of the antibody clones isolated, three were selected as best at neutralizing EBOV and triggering FcRIIIa. Binding studies and negative-stain electron microscopy revealed that the three selected antibodies bind to non-overlapping epitopes, including a potentially new protective epitope not targeted by other antibody-based treatments. When combined, a single dose of a cocktail of the three antibodies protected non-human primates from EBOV disease even after disease symptoms were apparent.This antibody cocktail provides complementary mechanisms of actions, incorporates novel specificities and demonstrates high-level post-exposure protection from lethal EBOV disease in NHP. It is now undergoing testing in normal healthy volunteers in preparation for potential use in future Ebola epidemics.
