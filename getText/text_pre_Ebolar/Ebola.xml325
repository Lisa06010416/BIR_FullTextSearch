An adenovirus serotype 2-vectored ebolavirus vaccine generates robust antibody and cell-mediated immune responses in mice and rhesus macaques.
Ebolavirus vaccines based on several adenoviral vectors have been investigated in preclinical studies and clinical trials. The use of adenovirus serotype 2 as a vector for ebolavirus vaccine has not been reported. Herein, we generated rAd2-ZGP, a recombinant replication-incompetent adenovirus serotype 2 expressing codon-optimized Zaire ebolavirus glycoprotein, and evaluated its immunogenicity in mice and rhesus macaques. rAd2-ZGP induced significant antibody and cell-mediated immune responses at 2 weeks after a single immunization. The glycoprotein (GP)-specific immune responses could be further enhanced with a booster immunization. Compared to protein antigens, Zaire ebolavirus GP and Zaire ebolavirus-like particles, rAd2-ZGP could induce stronger cross-reactive antibody and cell-mediated immune responses to heterologous Sudan ebolavirus in mice and rhesus macaques. In rAd2-ZGP-immunized macaques, GP-specific CD8  T cells could secret IFN-Î³ and IL-2, indicating a Th1-biased response. In adenovirus serotype 5 seropositive macaques, rAd2-ZGP could induce robust antibody and cell-mediated immune responses, suggesting that the efficacy of rAd2-ZGP is not affected by pre-existing immunity to adenovirus serotype 5. These results demonstrated that rAd2-ZGP can be considered an alternative ebolavirus vaccine for use in adenovirus serotype 5 seropositive subjects or as a sequential booster vaccine after the subjects have been immunized with a recombinant adenovirus serotype 5-based vaccine.
