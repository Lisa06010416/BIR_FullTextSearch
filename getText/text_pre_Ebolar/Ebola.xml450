Revisiting Ebola, a quiet river in the heart of Africa.
In 1995, 20 years after the first known Ebola outbreak, one of us (JPG) wrote an editorial about Ebola Virus Disease that captured the knowledge and attitudes toward viral diseases of that time and discussed the future of viruses in our world. Now, 21 years later, in the wake of the West African Ebola pandemic of 2013-2016, and after 22 other Ebola outbreaks, we revisit the article to determine if knowledge, attitudes, and practices have changed. We conclude that the necessary infrastructures (surveillance, financial, treatment/preventative health) have improved with each outbreak, and knowledge of the virus (vaccines, therapies, diagnostics) has increased. However, the global reach of the virus has also increased due to expanded means of global transportation. Furthermore, the knowledge of the virus that has increased with each outbreak has not translated into the necessary marginal increase in preparedness; we do not seem to be learning from our mistakes.
