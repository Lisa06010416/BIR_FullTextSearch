Computer-Aided Discovery and Characterization of Novel Ebola Virus Inhibitors.
The Ebola virus (EBOV) causes severe human infection that lacks effective treatment. A recent screen identified a series of compounds that block EBOV-like particle entry into human cells. Using data from this screen, quantitative structure-activity relationship models were built and employed for virtual screening of a âˆ¼17 million compound library. Experimental testing of 102 hits yielded 14 compounds with IC
