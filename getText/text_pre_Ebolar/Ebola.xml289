Analysis of a Putative Late Domain Using an Ebola Virus Transcription and Replication-Competent Virus-Like Particle System.
The Ebola virus (EBOV) matrix protein VP40 drives budding of virions and encodes 2 overlapping late domain motifs at amino acid positions 7-13 (PTAPPEY). However, these motifs are not absolutely essential for replication in cell culture, and recently a potential third late domain motif (YPx(6)I) was proposed at amino acid positions 18-26 of VP40. To analyze the importance of this motif in viral budding, we used a transcription and replication-competent virus-like particle system. Using this system, we show that this motif does not contribute to EBOV budding or particle propagation.
