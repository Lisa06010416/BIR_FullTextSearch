Evaluating implementation of the Ebola response in Margibi County, Liberia.
Implementation of the Ebola response was credited with reducing incidence of Ebola virus disease (EVD) in West Africa; however little is known about the amount and kind of Ebola response activities that were ultimately successful in addressing the 2014 outbreak. We collaboratively monitored Ebola response activities and associated effects in Margibi County, Liberia, a rural county in Liberia deeply affected by the outbreak. We used a participatory monitoring and evaluation system, including key informant interviews and document review, to systematically document activities, code them, characterize their contextual features, and discover and communicate patterns in Ebola response activities to essential stakeholders. We also measured incidence of EVD over time. Results showed a distinct pattern in Ebola response activities and key events, which corresponded with subsequent decreased EVD incidence. These data are suggestive of the role of Ebola response activities played in reducing the incidence of EVD within Margibi County, which included implementing safe burials, social mobilization and community engagement and case management. Systematic monitoring and evaluation of response activities to control disease outbreaks holds lessons for implementing and evaluating similar comprehensive and multi-sectoral community health efforts.
