Susceptibility of paramyxoviruses and filoviruses to inhibition by 2'-monofluoro- and 2'-difluoro-4'-azidocytidine analogs.
Ebolaviruses, marburgviruses, and henipaviruses are zoonotic pathogens belonging to the Filoviridae and Paramyxoviridae families. They exemplify viruses that continue to spill over into the human population, causing outbreaks characterized by high mortality and significant clinical sequelae in survivors of infection. There are currently no approved small molecule therapeutics for use in humans against these viruses. In this study, we evaluated the antiviral activity of the nucleoside analog 4'-azidocytidine (4'N
