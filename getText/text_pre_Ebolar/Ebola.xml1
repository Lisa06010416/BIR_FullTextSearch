Development and Characterization of Neutralizing Antibodies Against Zaire Ebolavirus Glycoprotein and Protein 40.
Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) are presently the most promising treatment against Ebola virus disease (EVD), and cocktail of two or more antibodies likely confers protection through complementary mechanisms. Zaire Ebolavirus (EBOV) glycoprotein (GP) and viral protein 40 (VP40) are targets for designing neutralizing antibodies. Currently, the antiviral therapeutics of mAb-cocktails are still limited solely to anti-GP antibodiesï¼Œthere is no Abs cocktail against Zaire EBOV GP and VP40, which both have important interactions with host cellular membrane.We used hybridoma technology to produce anti-Zaire EBOV GP mAb against GP receptor binding domain, and anti-Zaire EBOV VP40 mAbs against the N-terminal domain, the C-terminal domain, respectively; synthesized Zaire EBOV transcription and replication competent virus like particles (trVLPs), which model even all aspects of the EBOV life cycles in order to evaluate the anti-viral effect of mAbs. Then, we characterized the anti- Zaire EBOV trVLPs effect of anti-GP and VP40 mAbs in vitro by real time-PCR, immunofluorescence assay and western blot analysis.Our results demonstrate that anti-GP or anti-VP40 mAbs effectively inhibit trVLPs replication. The cocktails of anti-GP and anti-VP40 mAbs, or between anti-VP40 mAbs, had synergistic anti-trVLPs effect. Meanwhile, the detailed DNA and amino acid sequences of the mAbs were checked.The study verifies neutralizing efficacy of anti-GP or anti-VP40 mAb, report promising cocktail of anti-GP and anti-VP40 mAb, or cocktail of two anti-VP40 mAbs. To our knowledge, this is the first account to report the important anti-viral effect of cocktails of anti-GP and anti-VP40 mAbs in vitro.
