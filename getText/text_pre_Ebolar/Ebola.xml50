An Effective Way of Producing Fully Assembled Antibody in Transgenic Tobacco Plants by Linking Heavy and Light Chains via a Self-Cleaving 2A Peptide.
Therapeutic monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) have evolved into an important class of effective medicine in treatment of various diseases. Since the antibody molecule consists of two identical heavy chains (HC) and two light chains (LC), each chain encoded by two different genes, their expressions at similar levels are critical for efficient assembly of functional recombinant mAbs. Although the plant-based expression system has been tested to produce fully assembled recombinant mAbs, coordinately expressing HC and LC at similar levels in a transgenic plant remains a challenge. A sequence coding for a foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) 2A peptide has been successfully used to link two or more genes, which enable the translated polyprotein to be "self-cleaved" into individual protein in various genetically modified organisms. In the present study, we exploited the usage of F2A in Ebola virus monoclonal antibody (EBOV mAb) production. We found that transgenic tobacco plants carrying a transcription unit containing
