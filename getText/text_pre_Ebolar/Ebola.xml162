Immunogenicity of a Candidate Ebola Hemorrhagic Fever Vaccine in Mice Based on Controlled In Vitro Expression of Ebolavirus Glycoprotein.
Ebolavirus (EBOV) is the etiology of Ebola hemorrhagic fever (EHF). A major EHF outbreak in 2014-2015 in West Africa claimed >11,000 lives. A licensed vaccine is not available for EHF, although several vaccines have undergone clinical trials. We developed a human adenovirus (Ad) serotype 5-based candidate EHF vaccine based on controlled expression of the EBOV (Makona strain) glycoprotein (GP) as the immunogen. Two clones, AdGP72 and AdGP75, and a control Ad515 vector, were generated and tested for protein expression in vitro and immunogenicity in mice. Eight groups of mice were immunized with three doses of buffer, Ad515, AdGP72, and AdGP75, by two different dose regimens. Three different antigens (AdGP75-infected Vero E6 cell extract and two baculovirus expressed EBOV GP antigens, namely, GP alone or GP with EBOV VP40) were used to evaluate the immune response. Expression studies indicated that full-length GP was cleaved into its component subunits when expressed in mammalian cells through the Ad vectors. Moreover, in coimmunoprecipitation studies, EBOV GP was found to be associated with VP40 when expressed in baculoviruses. The candidate vaccines were immunogenic in mice, as evaluated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using mammalian- or baculovirus-derived antigens. Further characterization and development of the candidate vaccines are warranted.
