Mass spectrometric analysis of glycosylated viral proteins.
Viral diseases contribute much to human and animal suffering and enormous efforts are directed at developing appropriate vaccines for protection. Glycoproteins constitute much of the viral surfaces and are obvious targets for such vaccine development. This review describes mass spectrometric methods used for the structural determination of these compounds. Areas covered: The review describes the structures of the N- and O-linked glycans found on glycoproteins and mass spectrometric methods for their ionization and fragmentation. The steps, such as determination of glycan attachment sites and the structures of the attached glycans following their release from the glycoproteins are described and examples are given of the uses of the various analytical methods using mainly influenza, Ebola and HIV as representative examples. Also included are tables listing work on many other viruses. Expert commentary: Recent technological advances, such as the introduction of ion mobility techniques, have greatly improved analyses in this area and have enabled larger amounts of information to be gathered in shorter time periods on ever smaller amounts of material. Such techniques should greatly accelerate the discovery of vaccine targets and lead to the production of vaccines for diseases not currently available.
