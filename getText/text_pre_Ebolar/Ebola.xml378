Simulation-based training in Ebola Personal Protective Equipment for healthcare workers: Experience from King Abdulaziz University Hospital in Saudi Arabia.
Millions of Muslims from across the world gather annually to perform pilgrimage. This can import unusual communicable diseases such as Ebola. Communicable diseases with a high risk of mortality necessitate special training to master the required competency to avert transmission of infections. The efficacy of simulation-based training (SBT) has been shown in such circumstances.We sought to develop an SBT program in Ebola Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) for all healthcare workers (HCWs).We conducted a quasi-experimental study at the clinical skills and simulation center at the King Abdulaziz University. An interdisciplinary committee was formed to develop this program in three stages. Pre-intervention: Needs assessment "Diagnostic drill"; we conducted in-situ simulation in the emergency department (ED). High-fidelity simulator (HFS) was used as a suspected Ebola case to assess HCWs' competency of PPE. We used a checklist that was developed in accordance with the national and international guidelines. We then conducted "Train the Trainer in Ebola PPE" course to develop potential instructors.PPE competency SBT courses. This involved focusing on trainees to be skilled in Ebola PPE and becoming trained observers using skill stations and Ebola scenario with HFS, followed by debriefing. All courses gathered participants' evaluations, pre, and post-tests. Post-intervention: In-situ simulation in the ED two months later that was similar to the diagnostic drill.Pre-intervention: 7 HCWs were involved in the drill, the average score was 37% of the checklist items. For train the trainer, 19 potential PPE instructors attended the program; of them, 65% were female and 35% male, and 6 were physicians and 13 nurses. Average pre and post-tests scores were 72% and 86%, respectively.10 PPE courses that were attended by 179 HCWs; of them, 67% were female and 33% male, and 52 were physicians, 112 nurses, and 15 others. Pre and posttests were 67% (57-75%) and 85% (81-91%), respectively, with a p-value<0.01. Post-intervention: Post Program drill's average score was 86% of the checklist items (37% in diagnostic drill).Using SBT could be an effective method of developing competent HCWs in Ebola PPE.
