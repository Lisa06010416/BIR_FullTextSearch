Pediatric Infectious Diseases Meets the Future.
Pediatric infectious diseases physicians are dedicated to the diagnosis, prevention, and management of infections in children. As such, we play large, and important, roles in the clinical care of children from birth to late adolescence and in infection prevention, antimicrobial stewardship, research pertaining to infections, public health, international and global health, and advocacy for children's health. Furthermore, we are critical to the education of future physicians (in general), pediatricians, and infectious diseases doctors. In addition to diagnosing and treating bacterial, fungal, viral, and parasitic infections known through the ages, we have been at the forefront of meeting today's new infectious threats to children's health, which include the following: antibiotic-resistant organisms; hospital-acquired infections; global outbreaks such as Ebola, Zika, human immunodeficiency virus-acquired immune deficiency syndrome, and new strains of influenza; infections in immunocompromised children; vaccine-preventable infections; the inefficient use of medical resources; and the high cost of medical care.
