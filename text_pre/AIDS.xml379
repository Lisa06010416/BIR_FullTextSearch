Vaccination with the Conserved Caveolin-1 Binding Motif in Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type 1 Glycoprotein gp41 Delays the Onset of Viral Infection and Provides Partial Protection in Simian/Human Immunodeficiency Virus-Challenged Cynomolgus Macaques.
We have previously reported that the CBD1 peptide (SLEQIWNNMTWMQWDK), corresponding to the consensus caveolin-1 binding domain in human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) envelope glycoprotein gp41, elicits peptide-specific antibodies. Here, we have investigated the cellular immune response and the protective efficacy against a simian/human immunodeficiency virus (SHIV ) challenge. In addition to the CBD1 peptide, peptides overlapping the caveolin-binding-motif (CBM) ( IWNNMTWMQW  or  IWNNMTW ) were fused to a Gag-p24 T helper epitope for vaccination. All immunized cynomolgus macaques responded to a cocktail peptide immunization by inducing specific T cells and the production of high-titer CBD1/CBM peptide-specific antibodies. Six months after the fourth vaccine boost, six control and five vaccinated animals were challenged weekly by repeated exposure to SHIV  via the mucosal rectal route. All control animals were infected after 1 to 3 challenges with SHIV, while among the five vaccinated monkeys, three became infected after a delay compared to control; one was infected after the eighth viral challenge, and one remained uninfected even after the ninth SHIV challenge. Immunized animals maintained a CD4 T cell count, and their central memory CD4 T cells were less depleted than in the control group. Furthermore, SHIV challenge stimulates antigen-specific memory T cell response in vaccinated macaques. Our results indicate that peptides derived from the CBM region can be immunogenic and provide protection against SHIV infection in cynomolgus monkeys.
