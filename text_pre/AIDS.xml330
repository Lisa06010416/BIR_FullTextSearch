High Plasma Levels of sTNF-R1 and CCL11 Are Related to CD4+ T-Cells Fall in Human Immunodeficiency Virus Elite Controllers With a Sustained Virologic Control.
Our aim was to analyze the relationship between plasma inflammatory biomarkers and CD4+ T-cells evolution in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) elite controllers (HIV-ECs) with a suppressed viremia. We carried out a retrospective study in 30 HIV-ECs classified into two groups: those showing no significant loss of CD4+ T-cells during the observation period (stable CD4+,
