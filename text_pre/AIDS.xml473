Idiopathic intracranial hypertension associated with anaemia, secondary to antiretroviral drug in a human immunodeficiency virus positive patient.
Papilledema in a patient with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/acquired immune deficiency syndrome is an alarming finding. Any condition giving rise to raised intracranial tension (ICT) can cause papilledema, and in these patients, it could be secondary to opportunistic infections like meningitis to neoplasm. We report a case of a 28-year old female with HIV on antiretroviral therapy, who presented to us, with papilledema. Her fundus examination revealed superficial hemorrhages and Roth's spots along with papilledema. Patient was diagnosed with idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH), and all other possible systemic associations were ruled out. Her blood tests showed severe anemia. The papilledema and retinal changes resolved with treatment of anemia. This is a rare presentation of IIH in HIV positive patient due to anemia, secondary to zidovudine adverse effect.
