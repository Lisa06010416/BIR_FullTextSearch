Role of SDF-1 3'A polymorphism in HIV-1 disease progression: A systematic review and meta-analysis.
Chemokine stromal cell-derived factor 1(SDF-1) 3'A polymorphism has been reported to influence HIV-1 disease pathogenesis and progression, but the results remain controversial.A meta-analysis was carried out to evaluate their association.Comprehensive literature search of Pubmed, Web of Science and China National Knowledge Infrastructure was conducted. The strength of association between SDF-1 3'A polymorphism and HIV-1 progression was evaluated using the pooled ORs and 95%CIs calculated under different comparison models. Subgroup analyses, heterogeneity, Galbraith plot analyses and test for publication bias were also carried out.Our result showed that when compared with the typical progressors, the GA + AA and GA genotype of SDF-1 3'A polymorphism was found positively associated with the long-term non-progressors (LTNP) in the Caucasian HIV-1 infectors (GA + AA vs. GG, OR = 1.49, 95% CI: 1.02-2.18, p = 0.040; GA vs. GG, OR = 1.58, 95% CI: 1.06-2.35, p = 0.024), while AA genotype was found significantly higher in Asian LTNPs (AA vs. GG + GA, OR = 3.32, 95% CI: 1.25-8.85, p = 0.016).Our result suggested that HIV-1 infectors with SDF-1 3'A polymorphism have a higher chance of developing late AIDS than infectors with the SDF-1 GG genotype.
