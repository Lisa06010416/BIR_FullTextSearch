[Tuberculosis and comorbidities in urban areas in Argentina. A gender and age perspective].
Tuberculosis continues to be a major health problem in the world with an incidence of more than 10 million cases in 2015. There are factors that change the risk of developing the disease after infection, as well as the presentation of the disease.To determine the main comorbidities and demographic, clinical and microbiological characteristics of tuberculosis adult patients in Argentina from a gender and age perspective.We conducted a cross-sectional study in urban referral hospitals for patients with tuberculosis. We included tuberculosis patients of 15 years or more of age who were hospitalized or treated in outpatient clinics with bacteriologically confirmed pulmonary or extrapulmonary forms of the disease, as well as those who, although not bacteriologically confirmed, had clinical and radiological characteristics consistent with tuberculosis. The study period was from August 1st, 2015 to August 31st, 2016.We included 378 patients. The median age was 37 years. Male gender was associated with extrapulmonary tuberculosis, hospitalization, smoking, drug addiction and alcoholism. Tuberculosis and aids (22.6%) was related to drug use, admission into hospital, extrapulmonary tuberculosis, nonaddiction to tobacco, non-pathological radiology, absence of cavitation, and negative sputum smear microscopy. Patients less than 40 years of age had a higher rate of drug addiction and low weight, while those aged 40 or over had a higher proportion of diabetes, alcoholism and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).This study will help recognize tuberculosis patients' characteristics and comorbidities influencing the development and evolution of the disease from an age and gender perspective to enable the development of social and community-based strategies.
