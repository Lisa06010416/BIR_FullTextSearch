Eruptive melanocytic nevi in HIV infected patients: report of three cases.
The abrupt development of multiple melanocytic nevi has been described in association with many conditions, including human immunodeficiency virus infection. We report three cases of eruptive nevi in men with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 infection. One patient developed this phenomenon during the stage of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. The other two patients had human immunodeficiency virus infection recently diagnosed and presented to our clinic reporting the development of multiple melanocytic nevi after starting highly active antiretroviral treatment, with improvement of their immunity. To our knowledge, this is the first report of eruptive melanocytic nevi as a possible consequence of the immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome.
