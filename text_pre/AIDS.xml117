Prevalence of hypoalbuminemia in outpatients with HIV/AIDS.
Hypoalbuminemia may predict progression of disease and mortality in patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection/acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). This study was conducted to investigate the risk factors associated with hypoalbuminemia in outpatients with HIV/AIDS.A cross-sectional study was performed in 196 outpatients with HIV/AIDS.The prevalence of hypoalbuminemia was 11.7%. The only risk factor associated with hypoalbuminemia was current antiretroviral therapy (no exposure: odds ratio=3.46, 95% confidence interval=1.20-10.02).The monitoring of plasma albumin is key to determine when antiretroviral therapy should be initiated in individuals not exposed to antiretroviral medicines.
