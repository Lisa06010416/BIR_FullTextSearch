Ultrasensitive detection of HIV DNA with polymerase chain reaction-dynamic light scattering (PCR-DLS).
Early diagnosis of HIV biomarker or gene is the key to reduce acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) mortality. In our work, we developed a novel polymerase chain reaction-dynamic light scattering (PCR-DLS) assay for one-step sensitive detection of HIV DNA based on the average diameter change of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs). It is the first PCR assay that makes use of the DLS technique as signal read-out, the particle size measured by DLS increased with the concentration of target DNA. With the help of the AuNP probes, this PCR-DLS assay can effectively improve the specificity of PCR reactions, which can greatly increase the detection sensitivity, with a detection limit of 1.8 aM (S/N = 3). In addition, the proposed strategy was successfully used to analyze target DNA in human serum samples, indicating that the PCR-DLS assay has a promising potential application for rapid and early clinical diagnosis of HIV infection.
