Low variation in initial CD4 cell count in a HIV referral center, in Salvador, Brazil, from 2002 to 2015.
Early initiation of antiretroviral therapy increases the likelihood of effective immune restoration, quality of life, and greater life expectancy for HIV-infected individuals. We evaluated the evolution of mean CD4+ cells count at diagnosis of HIV/AIDS in Salvador, Brazil from 2002 to 2015. We identified HIV/AIDS patients older than 18 years with diagnosis of HIV infection from 2002 to 2015, who had their first laboratory evaluation at Complexo Hospitalar Prof. Edgard Santos, Federal University of Bahia. Initial mean CD4+ cells count and age, over time were evaluated. A total of 1801 patients randomly selected individuals were included in the analysis. Overall mean CD4+ count at diagnosis in the whole period was 279Â±265, varying from 191 in 2015 to 334 in 2011. There was no improvement in the immunological status at diagnosis from 2002 to 2015. In addition, a higher frequency of CD4+ cells count<200cells/mL in the last two years was observed. This suggests that the adopted strategies for early diagnosis of HIV/AIDS in Salvador, Brazil, are still ineffective.
