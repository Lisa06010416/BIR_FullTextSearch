A Case of Isolated Gastrointestinal Histoplasmosis.
Histoplasmosis is a self-limited and asymptomatic disease in immunocompetent individuals. Patients with untreated human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or immune suppression due to medications such as corticosteroids can present with disseminated and life-threatening infections. We present a case of a 60-year-old female that presented with recurrent diarrhea that was found to have isolated gastrointestinal (GI) histoplasmosis. The rarity of this case is due to the isolated colonic involvement and lack of respiratory symptoms (the portal of infection). In conclusion, clinicians should be aware of isolated histoplasmosis affecting the GI tract and careful endoscopic evaluation with adequate sampling is warranted to confirm the diagnosis.
