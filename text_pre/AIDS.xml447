Quality control of the traditional Chinese medicine Ruyi jinhuang powder based on high-throughput sequencing and real-time PCR.
Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has been practiced for thousands of years, although concerns about the efficacy, legality, and safety of TCM continue to be raised. Chromatographic studies have detected the presence of heavy metals and plant toxins within some TCM preparations. However, chromatography is not able to identify all of the compounds of TCM, particularly those items that are not clearly labeled on the packaging. The present study aimed to establish a supplemental method that better assesses the ingredient components of TCM preparations.We established an effective approach to screen the biological and toxical composition of TCM based on high-throughput sequencing (HTS), as well as fast detection and validation of the toxical species by real-time PCR, based on ITS2 DNA barcoding. Ruyi jinhuang powder (RHP), a classical herbal prescription containing the toxical herb Arisaematis rhizoma, was chosen to test the method. This method could determine whether the Arisaematis Rhizoma had been replaced by Pinellia pedatisecta in the RHP. The results were validated by real-time PCR. 90% compositions of RHP were identified by ITS2 DNA barcoding, suggesting that more DNA barcoding markers are needed for TCM identification. The strategy of high-throughput sequencing has the potential for comprehensive ingredient profiling for TCM preparations. Real-time PCR provides a expeditious metehod for monitoring the safety and legality of TCM preparations.
