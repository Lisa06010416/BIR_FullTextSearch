HIV-related stigma among people living with HIV/AIDS in rural Central China.
HIV-related stigma among people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) has been associated with many negative consequences, including poor adherence to therapy and undue psychological stress. However, the relative influence of specific demographic and situational factors contributing to HIV-related stigma among rural PLWHA in central China remains unknown. The aim of this study was to explore the level of HIV-related stigma among rural PLWHA across specific demographic and situational factors in central China.A cross-sectional study was conducted among PLWHA receiving care through the Chinese Centers for Disease Control of Zhenping county in Henan Province, China. Participants completed a 55-item questionnaire which included demographic and disease-related factors, HIV-related stigma was measured utilizing the validated Berger HIV Stigma Scale which has good psychometric characteristics in Chinese PLWHA.A total of 239 PLWHA completed the survey. The mean total HIV-related stigma score was 105.92 (SD = 12.35, 95% CI: 104.34, 107.49). Multivariable linear regression analysis revealed a higher level of HIV-related stigma in younger PLWHA (β = - 0.57, 95% CI = - 0.78,-0.35, p<0.001) and those who self-reported opportunistic infections (β = 6.26, 95% CI = 1.26, 11.26, p < 0.05).The findings in the current study suggest that rural PLWHA in central China suffer from the burden of HIV-related stigma at a moderate to high level. Younger PLWHA and PLWHA that have opportunistic infections tend to perceive a higher level of HIV stigma.
