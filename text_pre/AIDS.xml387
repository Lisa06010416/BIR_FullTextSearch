Prevalence of human immunodeficiency virus infection in brain glioma patients: Is the virus protective from gliomas?
Human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) is associated with an increased prevalence of some malignancies. However, some observational studies have revealed an ever-decreasing prevalence of HIV in glioma patients. The relationship between HIV and brain gliomas has not been well established.A cross-sectional study was carried out in sub-Sahara Africa, a high HIV prevalence setting, to determine the prevalence of HIV among all glioma patients over a 2-year period.A markedly reduced prevalence of HIV was found in glioma patients (8.3%) in comparison to the general population (14.3%). The presumably "antiglioma effect" of HIV and/or its treatment resulted in a 42% decrease in glioma occurrence in HIV positive patients compared to HIV negative individuals. Age and sex-adjusted prevalence were also lower among glioma patients with the protective effect observed more in younger patients and female sex.Our results corroborate the protective effect of HIV positivity vis-Ã  -vis gliomas. This "antiglioma effect" could be attributed to either the HIV, its treatment, or both. Future studies focused on this "effect" may help unveil better preventative and possible therapeutic avenues for gliomas.
