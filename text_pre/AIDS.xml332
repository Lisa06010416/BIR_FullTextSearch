A review on quinoline derived scaffolds as Anti-HIV Agents.
After restricting the proliferation of CD4+T cells, Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection persists at a very fast rate causing Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS). This demands the vigorous need of suitable anti-HIV agents, as existing medicines do not provide complete cure and exhibit drawbacks like toxicities, drug resistance, side-effects, etc. Even the introduction of Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy (HAART) failed to combat HIV/AIDS completely. The major breakthrough in anti-HIV discovery is marked with the discovery of raltegravir in 2007, the first integrase (IN) inhibitor. Thereafter, the discovery of elvitegravir, a quinolone derivative emerged as the potent HIV-IN inhibitor. Though, many more classes of different drugs that act as anti-HIV have been identified, some of which are under clinical trials, but the recent serious focus is still laid on quinoline-compounds and its analogues. In this review, we have covered all the quinoline-based derivatives that inhibit various targets and are potential anti-HIV agents in various phases of the drug discovery.
