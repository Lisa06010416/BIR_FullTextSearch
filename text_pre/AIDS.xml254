The Effect of a Short Period of Supplementation with Glutamine Dipeptide on the Cognitive Responses after a Resistance Training Session of Women with HIV/AIDS: A Randomized Double-Blind Placebo-Controlled Crossover Study.
The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of a short period of supplementation with glutamine dipeptide (GDP) on the acute responses to resistance training on the executive functions of people with HIV/AIDS. The sample consisted of 10 HIV+ women (45.00 ± 12.77 years old; 65.71 ± 12.04 kg; 1.54 ± 0.05 m) who were submitted to a randomized double-blind crossover procedure according to two experimental conditions: orally supplemented with 20 g/day of GDP or with maltodextrin for seven days. On the seventh day of supplementation all participants did cognitive function tests before and immediately after a resistance training session. Seven days of washout were adopted between conditions.
