Long-term pediatric hematological morbidity of the early-term newborn.
Children born at early term (37 0/7 to 38 6/7 weeks' gestation) are at an increased risk for long-term respiratory, cardiovascular, neurological, and developmental morbidities as compared with children born at full term (39 0/7 to 40 6/7 weeks' gestation). In this population-based cohort analysis, we sought to evaluate the long-term hematological morbidity of early-term born children. The cohort consisted of 223,242 term singleton deliveries. Hospitalizations of the offspring up to 18 years of age involving hematological morbidity were evaluated, including hereditary and acquired anemias, immunodeficiency disorders, coagulation disorders, white blood cell disorders, cytopenias, polycythemia, and myelodysplastic syndrome. Hematological hospitalizations were significantly more common in children delivered at early term as compared with those born at later gestational ages. A Kaplan-Meier survival curve demonstrated a significantly higher cumulative incidence of hematological-related hospitalizations in the early-term born group (logrank p < 0.001). Using a Cox regression model, early-term delivery was found to be an independent risk factor for childhood hematological morbidity with an adjusted hazard ratio of 1.15 (95%CI 1.01-1.30, p=0.027).Conclusion: Early-term delivery appears to be independently associated with pediatric long-term hematological morbidity of the offspring. What is Known? • It has been shown that children born at early term are at increased risk for short-term adverse outcomes including perinatal mortality. • Early-term infants are also at increased risk for long-term morbidity, mainly respiratory. What is New? • Early-term delivery is also independently associated with long-term hematological morbidity of the offspring.
