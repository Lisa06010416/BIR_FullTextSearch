Functional capacity and ventilatory efficiency are preserved in well-controlled people living with human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome.
To verify and compare the responses of the cardiopulmonary variables to the incremental test in physically inactive people living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) (PLWHA) with well-controlled disease and physically inactive healthy subjects (non-HIV/AIDS). Participants performed a cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPX) on a treadmill. Data were analyzed using the Mann-Whitney test and Spearman correlation. Nine PLWHA (5 women) and 9 non-HIV/AIDS gender and activity level-matched controls were included in the data analysis. Data are expressed in median (range). No difference was shown in the PLWHA group when compared to the control group in functional capacity (peak oxygen consumption [VO ]: 29.9 (20.9-36.4) mL/kg/min vs. 32.2 (24.5-39.4) mL/kg/min) and ventilatory efficiency (oxygen uptake efficiency slope [OUES]: 2,058 [1,474-3,204] vs. 2,612 [1,383-4,119]; minute ventilation carbon dioxide production slope: 27.4 [22.5-33.6] vs. 27.5 [20.4-38.1]). The results are also similar to maximal heart rate, oxygen pulse, gas exchange threshold, respiratory compensation point, heart rate recovery, and half-time of VO  recovery. OUES had a strong correlation with VO  in the PLWHA group (
