[Evolution of biochemical and hematological parameters in patients living with HIV/AIDS treated with antiretroviral therapy at the Aboubacar Sangoulé Lamizana General Camp Medical Center].
This study aimed to evaluate the impact of treatment on biochemical and hematological parameters in HIV-positive patients followed up at the Aboubacar Sangoulé Lamizana General Camp Medical Center in Burkina Faso.We conducted a retrospective study over the period January 2010-September 2015. The study only included HIV-positive patients treated with ART having undergone laboratory tests at treatment initiation (M0), at sixth month (M6), and at twelfth month (M12).Sex-ratio was 0.88 and the most affected age group was 45-55 years. The most prescribed treatments were triple combination therapies based on 2INTI + 1INNTI (74,5%), 2INTI+1 IP (14,9%). Viral load test was little requested. The rate of patients with normal laboratory tests showed a statistically significant regression between M0 (70%), and M6 (13%) (p<0.05). Severely immunocompromised patients showed a significant increase in average TCD4 lymphocytes value, ranging from 79,22 at M0 to 227.95 cells/mm  at M12 (p<0.05). Anaemic patients showed a significant increase in the rate of mean haemoglobin levels from 10.5 g/dl at M0 to 12.53 g/dl at M12 (p<0.05). The analysis of biochemical parameters could not be performed because of a lack of data.The increase in the rate of TCD4 lymphocytes and in the rate of hemoglobin levels gives an indication of ART effectiveness and of patient's tolerance to treatment. Viral load test accessibility and an improvement in laboratory testing monitoring are essential.
