Timing of Diagnosis: Understanding Resilience Narratives of HIV Positive Older Adults Diagnosed Pre- and Post-HAART.
Despite the growing population of older adults living with human immunodeficiency virus/ acquired immune deficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS), few studies have examined this population in terms of timing of HIV diagnosis. This study explores resilience and protective factors among HIV-positive older adults, 17 of whom were diagnosed prior to the development of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), and 13 of whom were diagnosed after the development of HAART.We explored the concepts of resilience and protective factors in 30 older adults living with HIV in Ontario, Canada. A qualitative approach was used to conduct in-depth interviews and grounded theory techniques were used to analyze the interview transcripts.Having lived with HIV for nearly 30Â years, the pre-HAART group had developed more personal strategies for enhancing resilience, including self-care behaviors. They were more regimented and dedicated to their daily health, and were more engaged in their medical care as opposed to the post-HAART group who viewed self-care as staying adherent and refraining from risky health behaviors.Although HAART has radically changed the prognosis of HIV, we have limited information about the differences between those who were diagnosed before and after the development of HAART. We will present recommendations for addressing previous trauma and improving self-care.
