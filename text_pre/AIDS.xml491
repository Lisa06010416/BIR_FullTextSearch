Design of Novel HIV-1/2 Fusion Inhibitors with High Therapeutic Efficacy in Rhesus Monkey Models.
T-20 (enfuvirtide) is the only approved viral fusion inhibitor that is used for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection; however, it has relatively low antiviral activity and easily induces drug resistance. We recently reported a T-20-based lipopeptide fusion inhibitor (LP-40) showing improved anti-HIV activity (X. Ding et al., J Virol 91:e00831-17, 2017, https://doi.org/10.1128/JVI.00831-17). In this study, we designed LP-50 and LP-51 by refining the structure and function of LP-40. The two new lipopeptides showed dramatically enhanced secondary structure and binding stability and were exceptionally potent inhibitors of HIV-1, HIV-2, simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV), and chimeric simian-human immunodeficiency virus (SHIV), with mean 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC s) in the very low picomolar range. They also exhibited dramatically increased potencies in inhibiting a panel of T-20- and LP-40-resistant mutant viruses. In line with their
