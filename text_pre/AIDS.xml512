Epidemiological trends and therapeutic challenges of malignancies in adult HIV-1-infected patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy in a tertiary hospital from Romania: An observational retrospective study.
Malignancies have become a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in people living with HIV (PLHIV). The primary endpoint of our study was to describe the epidemiology of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)-defining cancers (ADCs) and non-AIDS-defining cancers (NADCs). Epidemiological disparities, mortality predictors and survival analysis within the two groups of patients were key secondary endpoints.We retrospectively evaluated all adult PLHIV with histopathologically proven cancers registered from 2010 to 2016 in the "Matei Bal»ô" National Institute for Infectious Diseases, Bucharest, Romania.110 eligible patients have been included in the study. The incidence of ADCs decreased from 1.6% in 2010 to 0.3% in 2016, unlike NADCs which remained fairly stable over time (0.3%). The higher CD4 count and lower HIV-RNA level at the cancer diagnosis were associated with prolonged survival in ADCs group, but not in NADCs group. The mean CD4 count was 449/mm  to survivors and 92/mm  to non-survivors (p=0.017). The mean level of HIV-RNA was 64,671 copies/mL to survivors and 1,760,345 copies/mL to non-survivors (p=0.002).A good therapeutic control of HIV infection at the diagnosis of ADCs was associated with better survival, emphasizing the key role of the effective cART in the management of HIV-associated cancers.
