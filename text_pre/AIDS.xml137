Monkey Models and HIV Vaccine Research.
Since the discovery of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) in 1981, it has been extremely difficult to develop an effective vaccine or a therapeutic cure despite over 36 years of global efforts. One of the major reasons is due to the lack of an immune-competent animal model that supports live human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and disease progression such that vaccine-induced correlates of protection and efficacy can be determined clearly before human trials. Nevertheless, rhesus macaques infected with simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) and chimeric simian human immunodeficiency virus (SHIV) have served as invaluable models not only for understanding AIDS pathogenesis but also for studying HIV vaccine and cure. In this chapter, therefore, we summarize major scientific evidence generated in these models since the beginning of the AIDS pandemic. Hopefully, the accumulated knowledge and lessons contributed by thousands of scientists will be useful in promoting the search of an ultimate solution to end HIV/AIDS.
