Stigma and negative self-perceptions of young people living with human immunodeficiency virus in Bandung, Indonesia: a case series.
Young people living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) (PLWA) are at risk for HIV stigma.The HIV/AIDS Stigma Instrument for PLWA was administered to 36 young PLWA across six clinics in Bandung, Indonesia, to assess the fear of contagion (FC), verbal abuse (VA), social isolation (SI), workplace stigma (WS), health care neglect (HCN) and negative self-perception (NSP).The median scores for FC, VA, SI, WS and HCN were all 0 while the median score for NSP was 4. In the last 3 months approximately 45% of surveyed PLWA felt they did not deserve to live and 64% felt completely worthless.While these results are preliminary, access to mental health services should be a priority in the clinics that provide antiretroviral therapies.
