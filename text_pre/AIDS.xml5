Human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immune deficiency syndrome: A survey on the knowledge, attitude, and practice among medical professionals at a tertiary health-care institution in Uttarakhand, India.
Health-care professionals are trained health-care providers who occupy a potential vanguard position in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) prevention programs and the management of AIDS patients. This study was performed to assess HIV/AIDS-related knowledge, attitude, and practice (KAP) and perceptions among health-care professionals at a tertiary health-care institution in Uttarakhand, India, and to identify the target group where more education on HIV is needed.A cross-sectional KAP survey was conducted among five groups comprising consultants, residents, medical students, laboratory technicians, and nurses. Probability proportional to size sampling was used for generating random samples. Data analysis was performed using charts and tables in Microsoft Excel 2016, and statistical analysis was performed using the Statistical Package for the Social Science software version 20.0.Most participants had incomplete knowledge regarding the various aspects of HIV/AIDS. Attitude in all the study groups was receptive toward people living with HIV/AIDS. Practical application of knowledge was best observed in the clinicians as well as medical students. Poor performance by technicians and nurses was observed in prevention and prophylaxis. All groups were well informed about the National AIDS Control Policy except technicians.Poor knowledge about HIV infection, particularly among the young medical students and paramedics, is evidence of the lacunae in the teaching system, which must be kept in mind while formulating teaching programs. As suggested by the respondents, Information Education Communication activities should be improvised making use of print, electronic, and social media along with interactive awareness sessions, regular continuing medical educations, and seminars to ensure good quality of safe modern medical care.
