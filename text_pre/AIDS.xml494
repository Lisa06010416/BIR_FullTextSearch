Chylous ascites, anti-interferon-gamma autoantibody, and angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma: a rare but intriguing connection over Mycobacterium avium.
We report a case of non-AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome), non-CAPD (Continuous Ambulatory Peritoneal Dialysis), non-cirrhotic, Mycobacterium avium peritonitis, which is a rare form of mycobacterial infection. A 66-year-old Japanese man who had been treated previously for angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma (AITL), had developed disseminated M. avium infection. Antimycobacterial regimen improved his symptoms; however, following an interruption in treatment, he developed chylous ascites. The patient died of uncontrolled peritonitis despite intensive treatment. Anti-interferon-Î³ autoantibody was positive, and AITL was presumed to be involved in autoantibody production. A rare coexistence of chylous ascites, autoantibody, and AITL taught us an intriguing lesson on the pathogenesis of M. avium infection. Particularly, we conclude that treatment strategies for M. avium infection should aim to restore immunity.
