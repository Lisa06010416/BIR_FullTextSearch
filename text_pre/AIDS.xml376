Seminal Simian Immunodeficiency Virus in Chronically Infected Cynomolgus Macaques Is Dominated by Virus Originating from Multiple Genital Organs.
The sexual transmission of viruses is responsible for the spread of multiple infectious diseases. Although the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/AIDS pandemic remains fueled by sexual contacts with infected semen, the origin of virus in semen is still unknown. In a substantial number of HIV-infected men, viral strains present in semen differ from the ones in blood, suggesting that HIV is locally produced within the genital tract. Such local production may be responsible for the persistence of HIV in semen despite effective antiretroviral therapy. In this study, we used single-genome amplification, amplicon sequencing (
