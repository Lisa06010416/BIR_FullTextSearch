[Association between the viruses of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome and the hepatitis C virus among young blood donors in Kinshasa: Retrospective analysis of 10 years].
The screening of anti-Human Immunodeficiency Virus antibodies is mandatory in every blood donor admitted to the Blood Bank of Kinshasa University Clinics since 1984. However, no compiled data are available to date. The objective of this study was to establish the trend, prevalence, viral co-infections, and determinants of Human Immunodeficiency anti-Virus serology in blood donors admitted between 2003-2006 and 2008-2013.A retrospective analysis was carried out at University Kinshasa Clinics, using blood donors' records during 2003-2006 and 2008-2013. The prevalence of the human immunodeficiency virus per year, age, sex and type of blood donors were estimated. Independent predictors of human immunodeficiency virus seropositivity were also identified.Out of 26,341 blood donors, 2.2% (n=576/26,341) were seropositive for Human Immunodeficiency Virus. Age<25 years (OR=1.7; 95% CI: 1.4-2; P<0.0001) and Hepatitis C virus seropositivity (OR=3; 95% CI; 1.8-4.9; P<0.001) emerged as independent predictors of Human Immunodeficiency Virus seropositivity.This study shows a strong association between the Human Immunodeficiency Virus and hepatitis C and younger age respectively. Further studies are needed to ensure safety of Blood donation in Democratic Republic of Congo.
