Twelve Committed Men: the feasibility of a community-based participatory HIV-prevention intervention within a Canadian men's correctional facility.
The intervention objectives were to evaluate and describe the feasibility of using a community-based research (CBR) approach to adapt and implement HIV-prevention materials and tools with incarcerated men. We found no prior published reports about CBR HIV-prevention education in Canadian correctional facilities.Twelve members of the correctional Peer Education Committee (PEC) and Aboriginal PEC, whom a correctional nurse identified as being interested in preventive health, were purposively invited to participate. Eight participants were serving life sentences, three were Aboriginal and their education levels ranged from below grade 8 to 11 years of post-secondary education. The setting was a medium-security federal correctional facility, housing 324 men. The intervention was guided by CBR and 'greater involvement of people with AIDS' principles. Participants were invited to attend four workshops, over seven days in May 2014, and to provide their insights regarding future scaled-up CBR HIV prevention. Each workshop included an HIV-prevention presentation and a focus group discussion, two of which were audio-recorded.All participants attended all sessions. Synthesis of mixed-method findings, with quantitative and qualitative data triangulation, demonstrated two major outcomes: 'new knowledge was generated' regarding feasibility of CBR HIV prevention in a men's correction facility; and 'capacity building occurred' with increased participants' social capital. Thirty incarcerated men requested HIV testing following the intervention, because participants spread their knowledge about HIV prevention to others. Participants asked to become 'health ambassadors' - champion advisors for future scaled-up CBR HIV-prevention intervention for the entire correctional facility.CBR HIV prevention is feasible within a Canadian men's correctional facility.
