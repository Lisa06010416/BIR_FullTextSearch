Association of Urinary Biomarkers of Kidney Injury with Estimated GFR Decline in HIV-Infected Individuals following Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate Initiation.
Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (tenofovir) is associated with elevated concentrations of biomarkers of kidney damage and dysfunction in individuals with HIV. The relationship of these kidney biomarkers with longitudinal kidney function decline is unknown.We evaluated associations of 14 urinary biomarkers of kidney injury with changes in eGFR among 198 men and women with HIV who initiated tenofovir between 2009 and 2015 in the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study and Women's Interagency HIV Study. Urinary biomarkers included albumin-to-creatinine ratio, Median eGFR before tenofovir initiation was 103 (interquartile range, 88-116) ml/min per 1.73 m . During the first year of tenofovir use, eGFR decreased on average by 9.2 (95% confidence interval, 6.5 to 11.9) ml/min per 1.73 m  and was stable afterward (decrease of 0.62; 95% confidence interval, -0.85 to 2.1 ml/min per 1.73 m  per year). After multivariable adjustment, higher baseline Urinary biomarkers of kidney injury measured before and after tenofovir initiation are associated with subsequent changes in eGFR in individuals with HIV.This article contains a podcast at https://www.asn-online.org/media/podcast/CJASN/2018_08_28_CJASNPodcast_18_9_S.mp3.
