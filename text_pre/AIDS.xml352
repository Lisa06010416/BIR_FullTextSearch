Differences Between U.S.-Born and Non-U.S.-Born Black Adults Reported with Diagnosed HIV Infection: United States, 2008-2014.
Despite improvements in its treatment, HIV infection continues to affect Blacks disproportionally. Using National HIV Surveillance System data from 50 U.S. states and the District of Columbia, we examined demographic and epidemiologic differences between U.S.-born and non-U.S.-born Black adults. Of 110,452 Black adults reported with diagnosed HIV during 2008-2014 with complete country of birth information, 11.1% were non-U.S.-born. Non-U.S.-born were more likely to be older, female, have HIV infection attributed to heterosexual contact, have been diagnosed late, and live in the northeastern U.S. region. During 2014, the HIV diagnosis rate among African-born Black females was 1.4 times the rate of U.S.-born Black males, 2 times the rate of African-born Black males, and 5.3 times the rate of U.S.-born Black females. We elucidate the differences between U.S.-born and non-U.S.-born Blacks on which to base culturally appropriate HIV-prevention programs and policies.
