Current approaches to HIV prevention, treatment and care.
Acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) was first labelled as a new illness in 1981; it took two more years to discover a causative virus, which was named human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in 1985. Nurses who practised during those times may recall the fear, panic, stigma, ethical dilemmas and refusals to care that were associated with the pandemic. Four decades later, HIV can be considered a long-term condition rather than a life-limiting disease, as a result of developments in treatment. However, the UK has the highest number of people living with the virus since the pandemic was first identified, and there remains a need to challenge stigma and prejudice in relation to HIV and AIDS, to ensure that people receive timely access to HIV testing, treatment and preventive measures. This article explores the role of nurses in all areas of practice in preventing onward transmission of HIV, providing treatment and patient education, and promoting the well-being of people living with HIV.
