Experimental Adaptive Evolution of Simian Immunodeficiency Virus SIVcpz to Pandemic Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type 1 by Using a Humanized Mouse Model.
Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), the causative agent of AIDS, originated from simian immunodeficiency virus from chimpanzees (SIVcpz), the precursor of the human virus, approximately 100 years ago. This indicates that HIV-1 has emerged through the cross-species transmission of SIVcpz from chimpanzees to humans. However, it remains unclear how SIVcpz has evolved into pandemic HIV-1 in humans. To address this question, we inoculated three SIVcpz strains (MB897, EK505, and MT145), four pandemic HIV-1 strains (NL4-3, NLCSFV3, JRCSF, and AD8), and two nonpandemic HIV-1 strains (YBF30 and DJO0131). Humanized mice infected with SIVcpz strain MB897, a virus phylogenetically similar to pandemic HIV-1, exhibited a peak viral load comparable to that of mice infected with pandemic HIV-1, while peak viral loads of mice infected with SIVcpz strain EK505 or MT145 as well as nonpandemic HIV-1 strains were significantly lower. These results suggest that SIVcpz strain MB897 is preadapted to humans, unlike the other SIVcpz strains. Moreover, viral RNA sequencing of MB897-infected humanized mice identified a nonsynonymous mutation in
