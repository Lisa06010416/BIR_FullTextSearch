Behavior and health beliefs as predictors of HIV testing among women: aÂ prospective study of observed HIV testing.
Much of the research examining predictors of HIV testing has used retrospective self-report to assess HIV testing.therefore, may be subject to recall bias and to difficulties determining the direction of associations. In this prospective study, we administered surveys to women in community clinics to identify predictors of subsequent observed HIV testing, overcoming these limitations. Eighty-three percent were tested. In the adjusted multivariable model, being born in the U.S., perceived benefits of testing, worries about being infected with HIV, having had more than 15 lifetime sexual partners, and having had one or more casual sexual partners in the previous three months predicted acceptance of testing. Perceived obstacles to testing predicted non-acceptance. Those who had never been tested for HIV and those tested two to five years previously had greater odds of test acceptance than those who had been tested within the last year. The findings from this study with observed testing as the outcome, confirm some of the results from retrospective, self-report studies. Participants made largely rational decisions about testing, reflecting assessments of their risk and their history of HIV testing. Health beliefs are potentially modifiable through behavioral intervention, and such interventions might result in greater acceptance of testing.HIV: human immunodeficiency virus; AIDS: acquired immune deficiency syndrome; CDC: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; ACASI: audio computer-assisted self-interview; TRA: theory of reasoned action; HBM: Health Belief Model; STI: sexually transmitted infection; STD: Sexually Transmitted Disease; AOR: adjusted odds ratio; CI: confidence interval.
