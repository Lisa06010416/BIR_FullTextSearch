Molecular Changes of Lung Malignancy in HIV Infection.
Malignancy of the lung is a major source of morbidity and mortality in persons with human immunodeficiency virus infection; as the most prevalent non-acquired immunodeficiency syndrome-defining malignancy, it represents an important and growing problem confronting HIV-infected patients. To evaluate the molecular changes of lung malignancy in HIV infection, we analyzed differential gene expression profiles and screened for early detection biomarkers of HIV-associated lung cancer using Affymetrix arrays and IPA analysis. A total of 59 patients were diagnosed with HIV-associated lung cancer from Jan 2010 to May 2018. The primary outcome was a significant difference in survival outcome between stages III-IV (10.46 ± 1.87 months) and I-II (17.66 ± 2.88 months). We identified 758 differentially expressed genes in HIV-associated lung cancer. The expression levels of SIX1 and TFAP2A are specifically increased in HIV-associated lung cancer and are associated with poorly differentiated tumor tissue. We also found decreased ADH1B, INMT and SYNPO2 mRNA levels in HIV lung cancer. A comprehensive network and pathway analysis of the dysregulated genes revealed that these genes were associated with four network functions and six canonical pathways relevant to the development of HIV-associated lung cancer. The molecular changes in lung malignancy may help screen the growing population of HIV patients who have or will develop this malignancy.
