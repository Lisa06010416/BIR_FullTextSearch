Neuropsychological Assessment of 412 HIV-Infected Individuals in São Paulo, Brazil.
HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND) remain frequent even among individuals receiving combined antiretroviral therapy (cART). In addition, HAND may adversely affect the quality of life and adherence to cART. There is scarce epidemiological information about HAND in Latin America. This cross-sectional study recruited HIV-infected patients from a tertiary teaching institution in São Paulo, Brazil, between May 2013 and February 2015. The patients were adults with at least 4 years of education and patients with current neurological or psychiatric diseases were excluded. HAND remain frequent even among individuals receiving cART, use of psychoactive substance, or inability to understand the content for neuropsychological evaluation. We used standardized tools to evaluate depression, use of psychoactive substances, and daily life activities, and we performed a comprehensive neuropsychological examination. HAND was classified using the Frascati criteria. Prevalence of HAND was estimated, and an associated variable of symptomatic HAND was identified by logistic regression. Four-hundred twelve HIV-infected patients were included [male: 281 (68%), mean age of 45.3 years]. Most of them [n = 340 (83.7%)] had an undetectable viral load. The prevalence of HAND was 73.6% (n = 303): 210 (50.9%) had asymptomatic neurocognitive involvement (ANI), 67 (16.2%) had mild neurocognitive disorder (MND), and 26 (6.3%) had HIV-associated dementia (HAD). The univariate logistic regression analysis showed that female gender, age older than 50 years, <11 years of schooling, CD4 count below 200 cells/mm , presence of previous illnesses (e.g., diabetes, hypertension), opportunistic disease history, and a Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) score between 13 and 19 points were factors associated with symptomatic HAND (MND and HAD). However, a BDI score between 13 and 19 points was the single independent variable associated with symptomatic HAND. HAND was highly prevalent in São Paulo, Brazil, and ANI was the more frequent category of HAND. However, 22.5% of participants had symptomatic HAND. This finding constitutes a challenge in clinical practice. A BDI score between 13 and 19 points was the single independent variable associated with symptomatic HAND.
