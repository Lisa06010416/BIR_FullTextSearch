Review on the Biological Mechanisms Associated with Depo-Provera and HIV-1 Risk Acquisition in Women.
Women constitute more than 50% out of millions of individuals infected with HIV-1, the major causative agent of acquired immune deficiency syndrome. About 40% of HIV-1 infections have been reported to initiate in the female reproductive tract. However, the mechanisms through which these infections are spread are poorly understood; hence, there is now a major concern in women who use long acting injectable hormonal contraceptives, particularly Depo-Provera and an increase of HIV-1 risk acquisition. Based on literature, Depo-Provera has an affinity for both the glucocorticoid receptor and the progesterone receptor in the female reproductive tract. Therefore, investigating HIV-1 pathogenesis in the female reproductive tract via the glucocorticoid receptor and the progesterone receptor mechanisms in response to the effect of Depo-Provera is of great importance.
