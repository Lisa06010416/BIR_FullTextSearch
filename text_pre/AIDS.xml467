Correlation of apolipoprotein B mRNA-editing enzyme, catalytic polypeptide-like 3G genetic variant rs8177832 with HIV-1 predisposition in Pakistani Population.
Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection is a global health burden which ultimately results in acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). There are multiple host factors which are capable of limiting HIV-1 replication. One of the most important host factors which inhibit HIV-1 DNA synthesis is apolipoprotein B mRNA-editing enzyme, catalytic polypeptide-like 3G (APOBEC3G). Any genetic variation of this important host factor may influence host susceptibility to viral infection.The aim of the current study was to evaluate any correlation of APOBEC3G genetic variation rs8177832 with HIV-1 infection.The study involved 142 healthy control and 100 HIV-1 infected subjects. The genetic variation rs8177832 of all studied subjects was determined by allele-specific polymerase chain reaction (AS-PCR).The results showed that the distribution of rs8177832 genotypes AA, AG and GG in healthy subjects and HIV-1 subjects was; 42.253%, 42.957%, 14.788% and 66%, 27%, 7% respectively. Statistical analyses of data showed that there was significant variation of rs8177832 genotype AA in healthy control and HIV-1 infected subjects (42.257% vs 66%; p-value<0.001).Thus it was concluded that APOBEC3G rs8177832 AA genotype is contributing in genetic predisposition to HIV-1 infection in Pakistani population.
