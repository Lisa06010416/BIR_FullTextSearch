Knowledge and attitude of HIV/AIDS among women in Nigeria: a cross-sectional study.
The Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)/Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS) epidemic is one of the world's most serious public health and social problems. Promoting knowledge and attitude towards HIV/AIDS is a key strategy to control the prevalence of this growing epidemic. This study aimed to measure knowledge and attitude about HIV/AIDS along with the factors of association Nigerian women.This is a cross-sectional study based on data from the 2013 Demographic Health Survey (DHS) conducted among community dwelling women in Nigeria. A set of 13 questions was identified relevant to knowledge and attitude about HIV/AIDS. Each correct answer was scored as 1 and wrong answer as '0'. Normality of the variables was examined using Shapiro-Wilks tests. The socioeconomic and community factors associated with HIV/AIDS knowledge and attitude were examined by linear regression with dummy variables model.Means score (SD) on knowledge of transmission was 6.4 (2.0) and that for attitude was 2.1 (1.2). In the regression models, knowledge and attitude of HIV/AIDS were positively associated with survey years and respondents' age; geographical region was significantly associated with HIV/AIDS knowledge and attitude; rural respondents had significant reduction in knowledge [Exp(B)=0.86; 95% confidence interval (CI)=0.83-0.89] and positive attitude to HIV/AIDS [Exp(B)=0.91; 95% CI=0.89-0.93] compared with the urban counterpart, respectively.Findings of the present study suggested that women's knowledge and attitude about HIV/AIDS in Nigeria needs more attention to attain the global target to end its epidemics and other communicable diseases by 2030.
