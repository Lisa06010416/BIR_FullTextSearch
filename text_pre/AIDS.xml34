Knowledge and attitudes toward HIV/AIDS among the general population of Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.
In contrast to most regions of the world where a decline of the HIV epidemic can be seen, data from the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region suggests increasing incidence among key populations in the region. Accurate data collection has long been limited by social, cultural, and religious taboos. Understanding knowledge levels and attitudes toward HIV/AIDS is an important component to design adequate and culturally appropriate awareness and prevention programs.A survey was conducted including 3841 participants during a series of public HIV/AIDS awareness campaigns from 2013 to 2015 in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. Participants completed a questionnaire including socio-demographic data, and questions around knowledge and attitudes toward HIV/AIDS. A knowledge score was created. Frequencies were calculated for all variables, mean knowledge scores were compared using non-parametric tests. Categorical variables were compared using Chi-squared test. The mean knowledge score was 5.2 out of 9 possible points. Respondents in the age class 19-25, respondents with university degrees, and those who know people living with HIV/AIDS had higher scores. Overall the attitude toward people living with HIV/AIDS was negative, more than 40% suggested that HIV positive people should be isolated and less than 20% would support a marriage with an HIV positive person. Negative attitudes were more common among people in older age groups, with a lower educational background, and respondents that did not know anyone living with HIV/AIDS.Knowledge gaps and negative attitudes of the general public toward people living with HIV/AIDS have been identified and can be used to tailor educational campaigns in Saudi Arabia.
