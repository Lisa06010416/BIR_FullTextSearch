Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Early vs Late Diagnosis of HIV-Infected Patients in South Carolina.
It is anticipated that early diagnosis, linkage to care, initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART), and retention in care would lead to reduced opportunistic infections, reduction in human immunodeficiency virus-related morbidity and mortality and reduced rates of HIV transmission. This would be expected to lead to a reduction in the lifetime cost of care (LCC). This study analyzed existing data to determine to what extent early-versus-late HIV diagnosis affects LCC.The South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control electronic HIV/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome reporting system data were used for this study. The first CD4 and viral load reported to the Enhanced HIV/AIDS Reporting System of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are considered the initial CD4 and viral load. Late HIV diagnosis was based on a CD4 count ≤200 at diagnosis. A previously validated simulation model developed by the John Snow Institute for the South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control was used to determine the discounted LCC. Comparisons were made between late and early HIV diagnosis.From 2013 through 2015, 2138 individuals were diagnosed as having HIV in South Carolina; 180 individuals were excluded from further analysis because an initial CD4 count was missing. Final analysis was based on 1958 individuals. Late HIV diagnosis occurred in 509 individuals (26%). When stratified based on CD4 count at diagnosis, the discounted LCC per person in those with an initial CD4 count ≤200 was $262,374 and in those with an initial CD4 count >500 was $416,766. Those with lower CD4 counts at diagnosis had more lost quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs; 7.95 QALYs lost per person with an initial CD4 count ≤200 compared with 4.45 QALYs lost per person with an initial CD4 count >500), more lifetime HIV transmissions (1.4 per person with an initial CD4 count ≤200 compared with 0.72 per person with an initial CD4 count >500), and lower additional life expectancy (30.73 additional years with an initial CD4 count ≤200 compared with 38.08 additional years with an initial CD4 count >500).Although individuals with lower CD4 counts at diagnosis had a lower discounted LCC, they had more lost QALYs, more lifetime HIV transmissions, and lower additional life expectancy.
