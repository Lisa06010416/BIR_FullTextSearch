A Young Patient with Stroke and Primary Tuberculosis.
A 21-year-old woman presented with left hemiparesis, fever, dyspnea, tachycardia, and pericardial rub on examination. She was provisionally diagnosed with infective endocarditis and received the final diagnosis of the primary pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) and extra PTB (EPTB) with pericardial effusion and thoracic lymphadenitis. Left hemiparesis due to a pontine infarct was attributed to TB with neurovasculitis. The diagnosis was supported by findings on imaging studies such as echocardiography, computed tomography of the thorax, and magnetic resonance imaging of the brain. She improved with anti-TB treatment. It is interesting to note that she was not immunodeficient, with the usual suspects such as acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, diabetes mellitus, and renal failure ruled out. We conclude that PTB and EPTB must be considered in any febrile illness, even in patients who are not immunodeficient, considering its atypical presentation and prevalence in India.
