Effects of Talaromyces marneffei infection on mortality of HIV/AIDS patients in southern China: a retrospective cohort study.
Talaromyces marneffei is an opportunistic infection with high morbidity among human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/AIDS patients in Southeast Asia and southern China. Its effects on mortality in HIV/AIDS patients has not been clearly elucidated.We conducted a retrospective cohort study of hospitalized HIV-infected individuals at the Fourth People's Hospital of Nanning, Guangxi, China during 2012-2015. Kaplan-Meier analyses were used to calculate the cumulative mortality. Cox proportional hazard models and 1:1 propensity score matching (PSM) were used to evaluate the effects of T. marneffei infection on mortality of HIV/AIDS patients.In total, 6791 HIV/AIDS patients were included, 1093 of them (16.1%) with documented T. marneffei co-infection. The mortality of T. marneffei-infected patients (25.0 per 100 person-months, 95% CI 21.5-26.7) was the highest among all AIDS-associated complications and was significantly higher than that of T. marneffei-uninfected HIV/AIDS patients (13.8 per 100 person-months, 95% CI 12.5-15.1; adjusted hazard ratio (AHR) 1.80, 95% CI 1.48-2.16). The results using PSM were similar (AHR 4.52 95% CI 2.43-8.42). The mortality of T. marneffei-infected patients was also significantly higher than that of patients without any complications. When stratified by demographic characteristics, T. marneffei infection has higher mortality risk in all stratifications. Co-infection with T. marneffei carries a higher mortality risk in patients at any CD4  T-cell count.Talaromyces marneffei infection is commonly found in hospitalized HIV/AIDS patients in southern China and was associated with a higher mortality rate than most HIV-associated complications. These results highlight the need for improved diagnosis, treatment and prevention of infection by this neglected fungal pathogen in southern China.
