A Case of Jejunal Intussusception caused by Burkitt Lymphoma in an Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Patient.
Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma of B-cell type is the second most common neoplasm after Kaposi's sarcoma among patients with human immunodeficiency virus infection. Most non-Hodgkin's lymphoma cases that are associated with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) involve extranodal sites, especially the digestive tract and the central nervous system. We report a case of multiple jejunal intussusception caused by Burkitt lymphoma in a 42-year-old AIDS patient. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy and surgical biopsy were performed and a complete diagnostic study including histological and immunohistochemical analyses showed Burkitt lymphoma.
