Prevalence of Periodontitis and Soft Tissue Lesions among Human Immunodeficiency Virus-positive Patients on Antiretroviral Therapy in Raichur Taluk, Karnataka, India.
In countries where human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) is widespread and highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) medications are too expensive, or patients are failing HAART, oral disease management and risk remain an important issue.The aim of the study was to evaluate the prevalence of oral mucosal lesions and periodontitis among the HIV-positive adult patients and assess the association of these lesions with age, sex, duration of HIV, time on ART, dietary habits, and oral hygiene habits.Sample size was 170. Demographic data of the patients along with community periodontal index (CPI) and loss of attachment (LA) were recorded. Oral soft tissue lesions, such as ulcerations, sores, erosions, and fissures were also recorded. The study was carried out in Raichur Taluk, Karnataka, India. Convenience sampling design was followed. Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) version 20.0 (Chicago, USA) was used for data analysis. Chi-square test was carried out; p < 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant.There was no association between the oral mucosal conditions and the age and the adverse habits, such as tobacco and alcohol, CD4 count, and the time duration of HIV and ART among these patients. A higher percentage of people with 4 to 5 mm of pockets was seen with those who cleaned their teeth with a finger, which was statistically significant.The present study highlights the poor condition of the oral health of these patients and their unmet dental needs.
