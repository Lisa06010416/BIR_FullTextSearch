Esophagectomy in Patients with Human Immunodeficiency Virus and Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome: A Viable Option.
The objective of this study was to assess the outcomes for patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and acquired immune deficiency virus (AIDS) who had esophagectomy done for both benign and malignant conditions. A retrospective chart review of patients with HIV and AIDS undergoing esophagectomy at a rural referral hospital was done for the period of 2009-2014. Patient postoperative complications, outcomes, and follow-up data were charted. All procedures were done by a single lead surgeon. Nine patients met the study criteria, 7 of whom had esophageal cancer, and 2 with strictures. Four patients had received nutritional self-expanding metal stent preoperatively. The mean stent duration was 61 days. Three patients had been on antiretroviral therapy before surgery. Preoperative CD4 counts were available in 7 patients. Eight patients underwent a 3-field esophagectomy and 1 was unresectable. Seven of these patients had successful outcomes, with varying follow-up times. One patient died post procedure while in the hospital. Complications included stricture and anastomotic leak. Although HIV-positive patients face increased risk during surgical procedures, this status should not be a firm contraindication to surgery. Quality nutritional status, antiretroviral use, and overall CD4 count levels remain important parameters in considering surgical treatment for these patients. With careful patient evaluation and planning, esophagectomy in an HIV and AIDS setting is feasible with successful outcomes.
