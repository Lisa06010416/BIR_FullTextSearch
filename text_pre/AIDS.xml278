Kaposi's sarcoma of the conjunctiva and the eyelid leads to the diagnosis of human immunodeficiency virus infection - a case report.
The purpose of this case report is to describe a conjunctiva and eyelid Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) as the initial manifestation of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), which led to the diagnosis of HIV infection. There are only 3 reported cases of ocular KS as an initial manifestation of HIV infection.A 32-year old white man presented to our department with a 1 month history of eye redness. The patient had an enlarged violet-coloured mass on the right superior eyelid which had evolved over the course of 1 week. There was also a mobile bulbar conjunctival lesion with a bright red colour, approximately 5 mm × 5 mm, in the superior temporal quadrant of his left eye. The lesions looked like a chalazion and a subconjunctival haemorrhage, respectivly. Presumed KS diagnosis was confirmed with HIV-1 positive testing and histopathology from tissue biopsy. The patient's CD4 count was 23/mm  and viral RNA load 427,000/ml. Further systemic evaluation showed a diffuse sarcoma.This case report demonstrates the importance of recognizing the ocular manifestations of AIDS in establishing the correct diagnosis of KS and subsequently diagnosing occult HIV infection. Although ocular KS as the initial manifestation of HIV-AIDS is an extremely rare event, a proper diagnosis may contribute to prompt management with personal and social relevance.
