Maintenance of AP-2-Dependent Functional Activities of Nef Restricts Pathways of Immune Escape from CD8 T Lymphocyte Responses.
Nef-specific CD8  T lymphocytes (CD8TL) are linked to extraordinary control of primate lentiviral replication, but the mechanisms underlying their efficacy remain largely unknown. The immunodominant, Mamu-B*017:01 -restricted Nef MW9 epitope in SIVmac239 partially overlaps a sorting motif important for interactions with host AP-2 proteins and, hence, downmodulation of several host proteins, including Tetherin (CD317/BST-2), CD28, CD4, SERINC3, and SERINC5. We reasoned that CD8TL-driven evolution in this epitope might compromise Nef's ability to modulate these important molecules. Here, we used deep sequencing of SIV from nine B*017:01  macaques throughout infection with SIVmac239 to characterize the patterns of viral escape in this epitope and then assayed the impacts of these variants on Nef-mediated modulation of multiple host molecules. Acute variation in multiple Nef MW9 residues significantly compromised Nef's ability to downregulate surface Tetherin, CD4, and CD28 and reduced its ability to prevent SERINC5-mediated reduction in viral infectivity but did not impact downregulation of CD3 or major histocompatibility complex class I, suggesting the selective disruption of immunomodulatory pathways involving Nef AP-2 interactions. Together, our data illuminate a pattern of viral escape dictated by a selective balance to maintain AP-2-mediated downregulation while evading epitope-specific CD8TL responses. These data could shed light on mechanisms of both CD8TL-driven viral control generally and on Mamu-B*017:01-mediated viral control specifically.
