Induction of HIF-1α by HIV-1 Infection in CD4  T Cells Promotes Viral Replication and Drives Extracellular Vesicle-Mediated Inflammation.
Chronic immune activation and inflammation are hallmarks of HIV-1 infection and a major cause of serious non-AIDS events in HIV-1-infected individuals on antiretroviral treatment (ART). Herein, we show that cytosolic double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) generated in infected CD4  T cells during the HIV-1 replication cycle promotes the mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS)-dependent stabilization of the transcription factor hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF-1α), which in turn, enhances viral replication. Furthermore, we show that induction of HIF-1α promotes the release of extracellular vesicles (EVs). These EVs foster inflammation by inducing the secretion of gamma interferon by bystander CD4  T cells and secretion of interleukin 6 (IL-6) and IL-1β by bystander macrophages through an HIF-1α-dependent pathway. Remarkably, EVs obtained from plasma samples from HIV-1-infected individuals also induced HIF-1α activity and inflammation. Overall, this study demonstrates that HIF-1α plays a crucial role in HIV-1 pathogenesis by promoting viral replication and the release of EVs that orchestrate lymphocyte- and macrophage-mediated inflammatory responses.
