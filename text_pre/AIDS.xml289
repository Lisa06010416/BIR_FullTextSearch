Dynamics of Simian Immunodeficiency Virus Two-Long-Terminal-Repeat Circles in the Presence and Absence of CD8  Cells.
CD8  cells play a key role in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) infection, but their specific mechanism(s) of action in controlling the virus is unclear. Two-long-terminal-repeat (2-LTR) circles are extrachromosomal products generated upon failed integration of HIV/SIV. To understand the specific effects of CD8  cells on infected cells, we analyzed the dynamics of 2-LTR circles in SIVmac251-infected rhesus macaques (RMs) treated with an integrase inhibitor (INT). Twenty RMs underwent CD8  cell depletion and received raltegravir (RAL) monotherapy or a combination of both. Blood, lymph nodes (LNs), and gut biopsy specimens were routinely sampled. Plasma viral loads (pVLs) and 2-LTR circles from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and LN lymphocytes were measured with quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (qRT-PCR). In the CD8 depletion group, an âˆ¼1-log increase in pVLs and a slow increase in PBMC 2-LTRs occurred following depletion. In the INT group, a strong decline in pVLs upon treatment initiation and no change in 2-LTR levels were observed. In the INT and CD8  cell depletion group, an increase in pVLs following CD8 depletion similar to that in the CD8 depletion group was observed, with a modest decline following INT initiation, and 2-LTR circles significantly increased in PBMCs and LNs. Analyzing the 2-LTR data across all treatment groups with a mathematical model indicates that the data best support an effect of CD8  cells in killing cells prior to viral integration. Sensitivity analyses of these results confirm that effect but also allow for additional effects, which the data do not discriminate well. Overall, we show that INT does not significantly increase the levels of 2-LTR circles. However, CD8  cell depletion increases the 2-LTR levels, which are enhanced in the presence of an INT.
