Utilizing the Time Trade-Off, Standard Gamble, and Willingness to Pay Utility Measures to Evaluate Health-Related Quality of Life Prior to Knee or Hip Arthroplasty.
Time trade-off, standard gamble, and willingness to pay assess the number of years, risk of death, and income a patient would give up for perfect health. These questions were used to evaluate the impact knee arthritis, hip arthritis, or failed total knee (TKA) or hip arthroplasty (THA) has on patients' health-related quality of life prior to surgery.Three hundred sixty patients including 176 undergoing primary TKA, 127 undergoing primary THA, 31 undergoing revision TKA, and 26 undergoing revision THA were assessed. Time trade-off and standard gamble were converted to utility scores with 1.0 suggesting perfect health and 0 suggesting preference for death rather than living in current state. Willingness to pay is the percentage of yearly income that a patient would pay for perfect health.The mean time trade-off, standard gamble, and willingness to pay scores were 0.74, 0.83, and 0.32 without significant difference between procedures with the numbers available for study (P = .16, .31, and 0.41, respectively). Increasing body mass index was correlated with decreasing time trade-off scores (P = .014).Patients scheduled for primary or revision THA and TKA would accept an average 17% risk of death, lose 2.6 years of an additional 10-year life expectancy, and pay 32% of their income for perfect health. The time trade-off (0.74) was similar to patients with history of acute myocardial infarction (0.74) or minor stroke (0.72) and worse than those with chronic hepatitis C (0.83) or human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome infection (0.86). These data highlight the high value that patients place on adult reconstructive procedures.
