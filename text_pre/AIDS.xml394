Gender aspects on HIV prevention efforts and participation in HIV vaccine trials among Police officers in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania.
For more than three decades, Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection and Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) continue to dominate the health agenda. In sub-Saharan African countries, women are at more risk of contracting HIV and AIDS compared with men due to biological, social, economic, socio-economic and cultural factors. Women in the uniformed services may be more vulnerable to HIV/AIDS because of their work context, mobility, age and other factors that expose them to a higher risk of infection than women in the general population. This article describes gender dimensions, motives and challenges towards HIV prevention amongst Police officers (POs) in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania.This was a descriptive qualitative study conducted at Police stations in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. Fifteen in-depth interviews were conducted on POs; seven men, and eight women. Content analysis approach was used to analyze data.Participants' self-descriptions shed light on gender differences in relation to self -perceptions, job contexts, sexual relationships and HIV prevention. Both men and women perceived themselves as role models, and believed that the surrounding community perceived the same. Safe sexual behavior appeared crucial to avoid undesirable health outcomes. Risky sexual practices were considered avoidable. Under unavoidable sexual temptations, women in particular would be keen to avoid risky sexual practices. Some participants expressed positive views towards condoms use during extra-marital sexual relationships, while others had negative opinions. Early phases of HIV vaccine trials appeared to gain support from sexual partners. However, condom use during phase I/II HIV vaccine trials was deemed as difficult. Support from the spouse was reported to influence condom use outside the wedlock. However, religious beliefs, socio-cultural issues and individual reasons were perceived as difficulties to promote condoms use.These findings increase understanding of gender differences and context specific efforts towards HIV prevention. Individuals' assertiveness against risky sexual practices and the intention to participate in HIV vaccine trials to develop an effective vaccine are worth noting. Nevertheless, uncertainties towards condoms use underscore the importance of condoms' marketing particularly in extra marital sexual relationships and during early HIV vaccine trials.
