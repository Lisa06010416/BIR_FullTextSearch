Impact of a massive earthquake on adherence to antiretroviral therapy, mental health, and treatment failure among people living with HIV in Nepal.
The April 2015 Nepal earthquake resulted in more than 8,700 deaths and 22,000 casualties including damage to health facilities. The impact of this situation on chronic conditions such as human immunodeficiency virus infection and acquired immune deficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) may become a long-lasting public health threat. Therefore, the objectives of this study were i) to assess the association of antiretroviral therapy (ART) adherence with mental health problems, and social behaviors, ii) to examine factors affecting treatment failure, and iii) to investigate changes in ART adherence and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) among people living with HIV 6 and 12 months after the disaster.Study was conducted 6 months after the earthquake in 2015 with a sample size of 305 earthquake victims with HIV and followed after 12 months of the earthquake. A logistic regression analysis was used to examine relationships, while a paired t-test analysis was conducted to assess changes in adherence to ART and PTSD level at 6 months and 12 months after earthquake.In the earthquake, 5.2% of the participants lost their family member. Approximately 44% of participants had earthquake-PTSD symptoms and 50% experienced HIV stigma. PTSD and HIV status disclosure were significantly associated with adherence to ART, while HIV stigma and religion were associated with treatment failure. PTSD and adherence levels to ART were significantly improved over the 6-month period.Awareness programs for general public to eliminate HIV stigma; promote psychosocial counseling to earthquake victims living with HIV in order to reduce PTSD will contribute to maintaining optimal ART adherence and to prevent treatment failure.
