Epithelial Inclusions in Gallbladder Specimens Mimic Parasite Infection: Histologic and Molecular Examination of Reported Cystoisospora belli Infection in Gallbladders of Immunocompetent Patients.
Recent publications have described epithelial cytoplasmic vacuoles and inclusions incidentally noted within gallbladder epithelium and concluded that they represent coccidian parasite infection, in particular, Cystoisospora belli. We identified 8 gallbladder specimens from our institution in the past 3 years in which this diagnosis was suggested or in which similar epithelial alterations were prominent. Molecular analysis was performed on the 8 gallbladder specimens and on 3 positive control specimens: small bowel biopsies from acquired immunodeficiency syndrome patients with diarrhea. Polymerase chain reaction using primers designed to amplify an internal transcribed spacer (ITS2) in the C. belli ribosomal gene cluster was performed on the DNA samples. All 8 gallbladder specimens were negative for amplification, while a product consistent with C. belli was amplified from all 3 positive controls. Histologically, the gallbladder cytoplasmic inclusions stained diffusely positive for Grocott-Gomori's methenamine silver and Periodic acid-Schiff with diastase. In contrast, sections from a positive control small bowel biopsy demonstrated organisms that were negative for Grocott-Gomori's methenamine silver and showed a distinct capsular and punctate internal staining on Periodic acid-Schiff with diastase in various parasite forms. Together, the lack of molecular evidence of C. belli and the distinct morphologic and special staining patterns in these gallbladders compared with positive control small bowel suggest that these epithelial changes do not represent true C. belli infection. Our results suggest that gallbladders of immunocompetent patients may occasionally show epithelial changes that can morphologically mimic C. belli infection. Pathologists should be aware of this histologic variant to minimize unnecessary treatment, testing, and patient anxiety.
