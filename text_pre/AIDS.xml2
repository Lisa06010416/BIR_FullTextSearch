Hepatitis in AIDS patients.
The individuals with HIV infection are more susceptible to develop coinfections with infectious pathogens such as HCV and HBV. The routes of transmission of these pathogens are the same including sexual contact, injection drug use, or at birth from mother to an infant. The main reason of morbidity and mortality in HIV infected individuals is a liver disease in the context of antiretroviral therapy, and coinfection such as HCV and HBV complicates this condition. Nucleos(t)ide analogues are used for HBV infection management, and treatment of HCV infection is done by PegIFN and ribavirin combination and protease inhibitors. In this review, we focused on hepatitis B and C infections in HIV patients along with their therapies.
