Impact of co-infection by hepatitis C virus on immunological and virological response to antiretroviral therapy in HIV-positive patients.
We assessed the effect of co-infection by hepatitis C virus (HCV) on immunological and virological response at 48 weeks from initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART).We included patients from the Cohort of Spanish HIV Research Network (CoRIS) starting ART between January 2004 and November 2014, had at least 1 CD4 T-cell count and viral load measurements both in the previous 6 months and at 48 (±12) weeks from ART initiation, and HCV serology before ART initiation. We used linear regression for mean differences in CD4 T-cell count increase from ART initiation and logistic regression to estimate odds ratios for virological response.Of 12,239 patients by November 30, 2015, 5070 met inclusion criteria: 4382 (86.4%) HIV mono-infected and 688 (13.6%) HIV/HCV co-infected. Co-infected patients were more likely to have acquired HIV through injecting drugs use (57.4% vs. 1.1%), to be women, older, and Spanish, have a lower educational level, and having started ART with lower CD4 counts and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. CD4 T-cell count increase at 48 weeks was 229.7 cell/μL in HIV-monoinfected and 161.9 cell/μL in HIV/HCV-coinfected patients. The percentages of patients achieving a virological response at 48 weeks were 87.0% and 78.3% in mono and coinfected patients, respectively. Multivariable analyses showed that at 48 weeks, coinfected patients increased 44.5 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 24.8-64.3) cells/μL less than monoinfected and had lower probability of virological response (odds ratio: 0.62; 95% CI: 0.44-0.88).HIV/HCV-coinfected patients have lower immunological and virological responses at 48 weeks from ART initiation than monoinfected patients.
