Short-Term Pegylated Interferon α2a Treatment Does Not Significantly Reduce the Viral Reservoir of Simian Immunodeficiency Virus-Infected, Antiretroviral Therapy-Treated Rhesus Macaques.
The major obstacle to human immunodeficiency type 1 (HIV-1) eradication is a reservoir of latently infected cells that persists despite long-term antiretroviral therapy (ART) and causes rapid viral rebound if treatment is interrupted. Type I interferons are immunomodulatory cytokines that induce antiviral factors and have been evaluated for the treatment of HIV-infected individuals, resulting in moderate reduction of viremia and inconclusive data about their effect on reservoir size. Here, we assessed the potential of pegylated IFN-α2a (pIFN-α2a) to reduce the viral reservoir in simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV)-infected, ART-treated rhesus macaques (RMs). We found that pIFN-α2a treatment of animals in which virus replication is effectively suppressed with ART is safe and well tolerated, as no major clinical side effects were observed. By monitoring the cellular immune response during this intervention, we established that pIFN-α2a administration is not associated with either CD4  T cell depletion or increased immune activation. Importantly, we found that interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) were significantly upregulated in IFN-treated RMs compared to control animals, confirming that pIFN-α2a is bioactive
