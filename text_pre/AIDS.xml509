Diagnosis of platelet function disorders: A standardized, rational, and modular flow cytometric approach.
A high proportion of patients with mucocutaneous bleeding diathesis and suspected inherited or acquired platelet disorder remain without diagnosis even after comprehensive laboratory testing. Since flow cytometry allows investigation of resting and activated platelets on the single cell level by requiring only minimal amounts of blood, this method has become an important assay within the diagnostic algorithm, especially in pediatrics. We therefore developed a standardized and modular flow cytometric approach that contributes to clarify impaired platelet function in a rational step-by-step manner. Due to simultaneous analysis of four fluorophores in a basic panel design, we are able to readily detect the most common and clinically significant platelet disorders: Glanzmann thrombasthenia or Glanzmann-like diseases (fibrinogen receptor GPIIb-IIIa), Bernard-Soulier syndrome (von Willebrand-factor receptor complex GPIb-IX-V) and less well characterized Î²1-integrins that serve as the collagen, laminin or fibronectin receptor (CD29-CD49b, e and f, respectively). Platelet reactivity was investigated in response to the agonists adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and thrombin receptor activator peptide 6 (TRAP6) in suboptimal and optimal concentrations by quantifying surface expression of activation markers CD62P and CD63 as well as binding of PAC-1 antibody to the high affinity conformation of the fibrinogen receptor. For advanced diagnostic questions, several further modules were implemented: (i) calcium mobilization for evaluation of early signal transduction, (ii) a kinetically resolved mepacrine assay for estimation of delta-granule content and release, and (iii) a module to determine platelet reactivity upon additional agonists like the thromboxane A -analogue U46619 or collagen. Blood withdrawn from a healthy control cohort allowed generating preliminary standard values for all parameters. The modules were validated by analysis of patients with known or suspected platelet defects (leukocyte-adhesion deficiency type III, Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome, acute myeloid leukemia, sickle cell disease and chronic immune thrombocytopenia).
