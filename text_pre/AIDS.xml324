Primary Nasopharyngeal Kaposi Sarcoma as Index Diagnosis of AIDS in a Previously Healthy Man.
A 38-year-old, previously healthy man presented with blood-stained saliva and epistaxis. A 3Â mm nasopharyngeal lesion was found. A biopsy was performed and microscopic examination revealed a Kaposi sarcoma. The patient was subsequently found to be positive for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). The diagnosis of Kaposi sarcoma in the presence of HIV infection advanced his disease to Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS). Primary manifestation of Kaposi sarcoma in the nasopharynx is extremely rare. The histologic differential diagnosis of Kaposi sarcoma in this unusual site, especially without the clinical history of immunosuppression, is broad. Awareness that nasopharynx can be a primary involvement site of Kaposi sarcoma and serves as index diagnosis of AIDS is important given its serious clinical implication.
