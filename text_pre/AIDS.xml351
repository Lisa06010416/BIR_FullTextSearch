Ocular Manifestations of Human Immunodeficiency Virus Infection at a Tertiary Referral Center in Taiwan.
To investigate the prevalence and characteristics of ocular manifestations of human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) in patients treated at a tertiary referral center in Taiwan during a time of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) Materials and Methods: A retrospective cohort study in Taiwan was performed between January 2006 and July 2016. Ocular examination and systemic information were recorded from the HIV-infected patients.1242 patients with HIV/AIDS were identified. Ninety patients had ophthalmic records, and HIV-related ocular manifestations were reported in 57 patients. The most prevalent ocular manifestations were cytomegalovirus (CMV) retinitis, ocular syphilis, and HIV microvasculopathy. Mean CD4 count was significantly lower in patients with HIV-related ocular manifestations compared to those without.We found that lower CD4 count, especially <200 cells/Î¼L, was a significant factor for detecting HIV-related ocular manifestations. Comprehensive ophthalmic screening in high-risk group is helpful for early diagnosis and prompt treatment of sight-threatening ocular complications.
