Sustained viral suppression with co-administration of oxcarbazepine and dolutegravir.
Co-administration of dolutegravir and oxcarbazepine has been reported to reduce levels of dolutegravir and therefore is contraindicated due to insufficient data to make dosing recommendations. We present eight cases in which patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) inadvertently received oxcarbazepine while concurrently receiving 50 mg of dolutegravir daily as part of their antiretroviral therapy. Upon further evaluation, lab results revealed that despite the risk of decreased levels of dolutegravir due to possible oxcarbazepine enzyme induction, patients maintained at or near virologic suppression (viral load <20 copies/ml). Suppression was maintained in patients virally suppressed prior to oxcarbazepine initiation as well as in patients receiving high doses of oxcarbazepine (>1200 mg). All patients self-reported complete adherence to oxcarbazepine and dolutegravir. Furthermore, careful review of additional patient medications suggested no other identifiable drug interactions that could have affected their antiretroviral therapy. This case series suggests that despite the well-documented drug interaction, concomitant administration of oxcarbazepine and dolutegravir in the clinical setting did not adversely affect viral suppression in patients with HIV.
