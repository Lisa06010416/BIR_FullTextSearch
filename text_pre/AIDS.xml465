Mycobacterium Avium complex vertebral osteomyelitis in the absence of HIV infection: a case report and review.
Mycobacterium Avium Complex (MAC) is an established microbiologic cause of pulmonary disease, lymphadenitis, and disseminated disease in cases of advanced immune suppression. However, MAC manifesting as vertebral osteomyelitis is less common, and is particularly rare in the absence of Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS). Prompt diagnosis of MAC vertebral osteomyelitis is challenging, but necessary to prevent serious morbidity or mortality.We report a case of MAC osteomyelitis of the lumbar spine in a 70-year-old woman on extended duration corticosteroid therapy for systemic lupus erythematosus who presented with progressive back pain. Upon presentation, imaging revealed osteomyelitis of the lumbar spine with associated paraspinal abscess. Cultures from the surgical evacuation of the paraspinal abscess yielded no pathogen growth and she was therefore treated with empiric antibacterial therapy. Two weeks after her initial hospital discharge she represented with severe back pain and radiologic evidence of progressive disease in her lumbar spine. Two additional vertebral biopsies were required during her first 2 weeks of admission. MAC eventually grew from culture 14 days after collection. She was treated with ethambutol and rifampin and her symptoms resolved in 2 weeks, though therapy was continued for 12 months.MAC is an unusual cause of vertebral osteomyelitis in patients with AIDS, but is exceedingly rare in those without severe immune compromise. Despite its rarity, it must be considered in cases of vertebral osteomyelitis that do not respond to empiric antibiotic therapy. Multiple biopsies may be necessary to obtain a diagnosis and avoid destructive infectious complications of an untreated infection.
