Correlates of Protection Against SIV  Infection in Rhesus Macaques Immunized With Chimpanzee-Derived Adenovirus Vectors.
We report on prime-boost vaccine regimens with two simian adenovirus (Ad) vectors (SAdV) or two human serotype Ad vectors (HAdV) expressing Gag and gp160 of simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV)  tested in HAdV-seropositive rhesus macaques (RMs) repeatedly challenged rectally with low doses of SIV  Both vaccine regimens reduced set point and peak viral loads (PVL) and accelerated viral clearance. In SAdV-vaccinated controller genotype RMs resistance against infection correlated with levels of envelope (Env)-specific antibody (Ab) titers. In both vaccine groups CD8 T cells controlled viral loads (VL) upon infection. Circulating CD4  and CD8  T cells showed significant changes in their transcriptome over time following vaccination, which differed between the vaccine groups. T cells from SIV-resistant RMs had unique transcriptional profiles indicating that both follicular T helper (T ) cell responses and highly activated CD8  T cells may play a role in protection.
