Catch Me If You Can.
Nocardia is a genus of anaerobic gram-positive bacteria that most commonly infect persons with compromised immunity. Pneumonia and soft tissue infections are seen most frequently; osteomyelitis is an uncommonly reported manifestation of nocardiosis. We report a case of pelvic osteomyelitis due to Nocardia asteroides in a patient with unrecognized acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) without evidence of concomitant pulmonary or skin infection.
