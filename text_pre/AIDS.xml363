Investigation of mother-to-child transmission of HIV in pregnancy and among HIV-exposed infants accessing care at a PMTCT clinic in southwest Nigeria.
Over 90% of infant acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) cases have been through mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Consequent to this, prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) programs have instituted as dual purposes for prevention of HIV transmission from mother to child and enrollment of infected pregnant women and their families into antiretroviral treatment (ART) program. However, there are still some breakthrough infections and challenges. Therefore, this study was designed to assess risk of HIV transmission among HIV-exposed infants on follow-up at a PMTCT clinic in an antiretroviral (ARV) referral health facility in southwest Nigeria.A cohort of 60 purposively recruited consenting pregnant women referred to PMTCT HIV clinic in Ibadan, southwest Nigeria were enrolled and followed up for 1 year (2015-2016). A well-structured epidemiological questionnaire was used to capture all relevant information. Data were then analyzed by SPSS version 21 (St. Louis, MO, USA), while bivariate and multivariate analyses were used to identify associations.A total of 44 mothers and their infants were available for the analysis with an attrition rate of 26.7%. The mean age of mothers at enrollment to follow-up was 32.9 years (SD = 4.2 years). Two (4.5%, 95% CI: 7.2-12.3%) of the infants were HIV positive by DNA PCR test. There was no linear relationship between age of the mothers with CD4 count or viral load both before and after delivery but there was a significant positive relationship with year on ARV (r = 0.318, 95% CI: 0.024-0.562). Infants of rural dwelling mothers were at 3.39 (adjusted odds ratio (AOR) = 3.39, 95% CI: 1.32, 2.29) times higher risk of vertical HIV transmission compared to those of urban dwelling mothers. Infants delivered at home had 2.61(AOR = 2.61, 95% CI: 1.59, 7.91) times higher risk of MTCT compared to those delivered at health institution. Mixed feeding was also another important predictor in which the risk of MTCT was about two (AOR = 2.21, 95% CI: 0.68, 9.97) times higher compared to exclusive breastfeeding.There was a high risk of MTCT of HIV among exposed infants on follow-up at the PMTCT clinic of Adeoyo Maternity Teaching referral hospital. Our findings will assist health policy makers in providing important information capable of enhancing assurance HIV control in such population and in raising the standard of PMTCT program in Nigeria.
