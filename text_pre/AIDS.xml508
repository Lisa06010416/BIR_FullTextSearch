Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 1 (SOCS1) and SOCS3 Are Stimulated within the Eye during Experimental Murine Cytomegalovirus Retinitis in Mice with Retrovirus-Induced Immunosuppression.
AIDS-related human cytomegalovirus retinitis remains the leading cause of blindness among untreated HIV/AIDS patients worldwide. To study mechanisms of this disease, we used a clinically relevant animal model of murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) retinitis with retrovirus-induced murine AIDS (MAIDS) that mimics the progression of AIDS in humans. We found in this model that MCMV infection significantly stimulates ocular suppressor of cytokine signaling 1 (SOCS1) and SOCS3, host proteins which hinder immune-related signaling by cytokines, including antiviral type I and type II interferons. The present study demonstrates that in the absence of retinal disease, systemic MCMV infection of mice without MAIDS, but not in mice with MAIDS, leads to mild stimulation of splenic SOCS1 mRNA. In sharp contrast, when MCMV is directly inoculated into the eyes of retinitis-susceptible MAIDS mice, high levels of intraocular SOCS1 and SOCS3 mRNA and protein are produced which are associated with significant intraocular upregulation of gamma interferon (IFN-Î³) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) mRNA expression. We also show that infiltrating macrophages, granulocytes, and resident retinal cells are sources of intraocular SOCS1 and SOCS3 protein production during development of MAIDS-related MCMV retinitis, and SOCS1 and SOCS3 mRNA transcripts are detected in retinal areas histologically characteristic of MCMV retinitis. Furthermore, SOCS1 and SOCS3 are found in both MCMV-infected cells and uninfected cells, suggesting that these SOCS proteins are stimulated via a bystander mechanism during MCMV retinitis. Taken together, our findings suggest a role for MCMV-related stimulation of SOCS1 and SOCS3 in the progression of retinal disease during ocular, but not systemic, MCMV infection.
