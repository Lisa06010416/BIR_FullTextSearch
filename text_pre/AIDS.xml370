Reduced Chronic Lymphocyte Activation following Interferon Alpha Blockade during the Acute Phase of Simian Immunodeficiency Virus Infection in Rhesus Macaques.
Pathogenic human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) infection of humans and rhesus macaques (RMs) induces persistently high production of type I interferon (IFN-I), which is thought to contribute to disease progression. To elucidate the specific role of interferon alpha (IFN-α) in SIV pathogenesis, 12 RMs were treated prior to intravenous (i.v.) SIV  infection with a high or a low dose of an antibody (AGS-009) that neutralizes most IFN-α subtypes and were compared with six mock-infused, SIV-infected controls. Plasma viremia was measured postinfection to assess the effect of IFN-α blockade on virus replication, and peripheral blood and lymphoid tissue samples were analyzed by immunophenotypic staining. Consistent with the known antiviral effect of IFN-I, high-dose AGS-009 treatment induced a modest increase in acute-phase viral loads versus controls. Four out of 6 RMs receiving a high dose of AGS-009 also experienced an early decline in CD4  T cell counts that was associated with progression to AIDS. Interestingly, 50% of the animals treated with AGS-009 (6/12) developed AIDS within 1 year of infection compared with 17% (1/6) of untreated controls. Finally, blockade of IFN-α decreased the levels of activated CD4  and CD8  T cells, as well as B cells, as measured by PD-1 and/or Ki67 expression. The lower levels of activated lymphocytes in IFN-α-blockaded animals supports the hypothesis that IFN-α signaling contributes to lymphocyte activation during SIV infection and suggests that this signaling pathway is involved in controlling virus replication during acute infection. The potential anti-inflammatory effect of IFN-α blockade should be explored as a strategy to reduce immune activation in HIV-infected individuals.
