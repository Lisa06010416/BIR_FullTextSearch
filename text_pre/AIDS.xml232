Clinical Characteristics and Prognostic Analysis of Glioma in Human Immunodeficiency Virus-Infected Patients.
To perform a survival analysis of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-patients with glioma and to assess the relationship between various prognostic factors and overall survival (OS).We reported in detail the management and prognosis of 2 HIV-infected patients with glioma in our hospital and performed a quantitative and comprehensive systematic literature review of patients with HIV-associated glioma. We combined our treatment experience with retrospectively obtained treatment information and studied the survival time to statistically analyze whether age, sex, World Health Organization (WHO) grade, surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and combined radiotherapy and chemotherapy could predict patient survival.The study included 34 cases, including our own 2 cases. The median survival was 9 months. On survival analysis, among the aforementioned parameters, WHO grade (low-grade glioma/high-grade glioma), surgery (surgical resection/stereotactic biopsy), and radiotherapy showed a significant association with OS by univariate analysis. Multivariate analysis showed WHO grade and surgery were significant predictors of OS.Most patients had astrocytoma or high-grade glioma. The median survival of all HIV-infected patients with gliomas was shorter than that of GBM patients with glioblastoma multiforme. Surgery and WHO grade were independent prognostic factors for OS.
