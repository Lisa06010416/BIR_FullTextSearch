Type I Interferon Responses by HIV-1 Infection: Association with Disease Progression and Control.
Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) is the causative agent of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome and its infection leads to the onset of several disorders such as the depletion of peripheral CD4  T cells and immune activation. HIV-1 is recognized by innate immune sensors that then trigger the production of type I interferons (IFN-Is). IFN-Is are well-known cytokines eliciting broad anti-viral effects by inducing the expression of anti-viral genes called interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs). Extensive
