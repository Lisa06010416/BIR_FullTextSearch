Multiple Extradural Spinal Meningiomas in a Patient with Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome: Case Report and Literature Review.
Purely extradural spinal meningiomas are uncommon. Due to their typical location in the neural foramen, they are often mistaken for schwannomas, neurofibromas, and epidural metastases. In addition, comorbid conditions such as immunodeficiency may obscure the diagnosis. We present a case of extradural spinal meningiomas in a patient with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). This is the first reported case of multiple extradural spinal meningiomas in 2 separate regions of the spine.A 40-year-old male with a past medical history of HIV and hepatitis B infection presented with a 2-month history of progressive back pain radiating to the left flank and thigh. Magnetic resonance imaging of the thoracic and lumbar spine with intravenous gadolinium contrast revealed 2 extramedullary masses in the left neural foramina of T6 and L1. The patient underwent laminectomy, which revealed that the 2 lesions were entirely extradural. Both lesions were resected, and the histological diagnosis for both lesions was meningioma, World Health Organization grade I.Our experience with this 40-year-old male with AIDS who presented with radicular symptoms due to multiple purely extradural meningiomas underscores the importance of considering meningioma as a possible diagnosis in patients with tumors of the neural foramina. In addition, a wide differential diagnosis should be made for patients with spinal lesions and history of HIV, including illnesses that are related to immunodeficiency and those that are not.
