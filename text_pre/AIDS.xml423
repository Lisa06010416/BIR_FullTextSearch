Distribution of killer immunoglobulin-like receptor genes in HIV infected long-term non-progressors from Mumbai, India.
Few reports suggest the association of killer immunoglobulin-like receptors of natural killer cells with human immunodeficiency virus infection. India with world's third largest population of human immunodeficiency virus / acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, offers scope to study such association.Current study (2010-2015) was designed to evaluate if killer immunoglobulin-like receptors gene polymorphisms are associated with HIV infection outcomes specifically, with long term non progressors.Killer immunoglobulin-like receptors genotyping was done using polymerase chain reaction - sequence-specific primer method. Viral load was measured by Cobas Taqman HIV-1 test. Estimation of CD4 counts was done using BD FACS CD4 count reagent.The activating gene frequencies identified were 3DS1 (53.8%), 2DS3 (69.2%), 2DS4 (76.9%), 2DS5 (69.2%), 2DS1 (76.9%) and 2DS2 (92.3%). The inhibitory gene frequencies were 2DL2 (92.3%), 2DL5 (76.9%), 2DL3 (69.5%), 3DL1 (84.6%), 3DL2 (92.3%) and 2DL1 (100%). The results highlight high frequency of 3DS1/3DL1 heterozygote and killer immunoglobulin-like receptor 2DS1, among these long term non progressors indicating their possible association with slow progression. Genotype analysis shows total 13 genotypes, of which 8 genotypes were identified for the first time from India. Two genotypes were unique/novel, which were unreported. All genotypes observed in this study were considered to be Bx genotype (100 %).A small sample size (n=13, due to a rare cohort) and the absence of control group were the limitations of this study.The present study highlights the distribution of killer immunoglobulin-like receptor genes in a very rare group of human immunodeficiency virus -1 infected individuals - long term non progressors. All the long term non progressors tested show the presence of Bx haplotype and each long term non progressors has a different killer immunoglobulin-like receptor genotype.
