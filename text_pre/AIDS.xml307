Molecular diagnosis of microsporidia strains in slaughtered cows of southwest of Iran.
Microsporidia is often considered as an opportunistic infection in patients with impaired immune systems such as patients with acquired immune deficiency syndrome, transplant recipients, children and old people. Due to the ability of the parasite to transmit from animals to human as well as the increasing prevalence of parasitic infections and immune deficiency diseases; therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate molecular diagnosis of microsporidia strains in slaughtered cows of southwest of Iran. Initially, 256 stool samples of cows were collected from 5 regions of Khuzestan province, southwest of Iran and stained by modified trichrome (weber). Then, the parasite spores were examined by optical microscope. Total DNA was extracted from samples using DNA extraction kit for stool (Bioneer) and evaluated by multiplex/nested PCR method. The products of nested-PCR were explored by RFLP method using restriction enzyme
