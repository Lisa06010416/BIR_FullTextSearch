Epidemiological and Clinical Characteristics of HIV Infected Patients at a Tertiary Care Hospital in Oman.
In 2015, the Joint United Nations Program on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) set a target that 90% of all people living with HIV will know their HIV status, 90% of those diagnosed will receive antiretroviral therapy, and 90% of those receiving antiretroviral therapy will have viral suppression by 2020. We sought to elucidate the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of HIV infected patients at the Infectious Diseases Clinic at Royal Hospital, Oman, with a focus on the UNAIDS 90-90-90 achieved rates.We conducted a retrospective analysis of the medical records of 326 HIV infected patients from 1989 to 2016. Data collected included demographics, Word Health Organization (WHO) staging, laboratory analyses, and treatment outcomes.The overall mean age of the cohort was 36.0±15.0 years, and 60.4% (n = 197) were males. The majority of patients acquired HIV through heterosexual transmission (58.9%; n = 192). At the time of the first clinic visit, 26.1% (n = 85) of patients had WHO stage 4 HIV infection. The rates of HIV/HBV and HIV/HCV coinfections were 2.7% and 5.8%, respectively. The baseline CD4+ cells count was < 200 cells/mm  in 38.0% (n = 124) of patients, 201-500 cells/mm  in 30.1% (n = 99) of patients, and > 500 cells/mm  in 27.0% (n = 88) of patients. The baseline HIV RNA titer was greater than 1000 copies/mL  in 74.5% (n = 243) of the cohort. A total of 96.3% (n = 314) of patients received antiretroviral therapy, most commonly non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor-based regimens. HIV genotype resistance testing was performed in 165 patients (50.6%) either at baseline in treatment naïve patients or following treatment failure. Among the 326 patients included, 22 patients (6.7%) died, and 29 patients (8.9%) were lost to follow-up.Regarding the UNAIDs 90-90-90 target, over a quarter of the patients presented late with WHO stage 4 HIV disease, 96.3% of cohort patients received antiretroviral treatment, and 71.5% achieved virological suppression.
