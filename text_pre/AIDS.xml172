Anticipating Needs at End of Life in Narratives Related by People Living With HIV/AIDS in Appalachia.
As part of a mixed methods study determining end-of-life and advanced care planning needs in southern Appalachia, a narrative analysis was done of stories told in interviews of 8 selected participants using transcript data. Narratives were fraught with contradiction and paradox. Tensions were evident about living in Appalachia, the Bible Belt, and an area wherein distances are long and community rejection can occur as news travels quickly. The primary finding was that stigma, from several sources, and shrinking circles of social support for people living with HIV/AIDS, all of whom were in treatment, combined to create a sense of solitariness. Narratives were fraught with tensions, contradictions, and paradoxes. Living in Appalachia, the Bible Belt, and an area wherein distances are long and community rejection can occur as news travels quickly. The rejection-based religiously based stigma was often predicated on stereotypes about sexual behavior and illicit drug use. Diagnosis was a key turning point after which many spiraled downward financially and socially. Implications for research and advanced care planning are included.
