Effects of HIV on metabolic and biological pathways of CD4  T lymphocytes.
The effects of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) on the metabolic and biological pathways of cluster of differentiation (CD)4  T lymphocytes were investigated. A total of 150 patients with acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) and 50 healthy individuals who were admitted to hospital for physical examination during the period of June 2016 to January 2017, were selected as subjects in the present study. According to the virus load, 150 AIDS patients were divided into three groups: i) Viral load >10  copies/ml (group A, n=39), ii) 10  copies/ml < viral load <10  copies/ml (group B, n=76), and iii) viral load <10  copies/ml (group C, n=35). The relationship between viral loads in the three groups and CD4  T lymphocyte counts was assessed. Active lymphocytes were isolated from T lymphocytes in the subjects, and the ratio of Th1 to Th2 was measured by flow cytometry. Effects of HIV on human T-lymphocyte differentiation were observed. Differences in T-lymphocyte metabolites were detected by proton nuclear magnetic resonance and their biological pathways analyzed. The results showed that CD4  T-cell counts were decreased with the increase of the viral loads of patients. The viral loads of AIDS patients differentiated T lymphocytes. In other words, high viral loads accelerated the differentiation of T lymphocytes into Th1 cells. In the high HIV viral load group, the levels of glycerol phosphodiesterase, 7-dehydrocholesterol, p-hydroxyphenylacetic acid, cholesterol and deoxyuridine were increased, but the levels of 3-methoxytyramine, cytidine deaminase, deoxycorticosterone and 3-hydroxybutyric acid were decreased. The viral loads of AIDS patients are associated with CD4  T-cell counts and the ratio of CD4  T to CD8  T cells. At the same time, HIV viral loads can affect the lipid biosynthesis of T-lymphocyte membranes, thus affecting the differentiation and proliferation of T lymphocytes and finally intervening its mediated immune responses.
