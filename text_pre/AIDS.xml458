Emergence of resistance mutations in simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV)-infected rhesus macaques receiving non-suppressive antiretroviral therapy (ART).
Two SIVmac251-infected rhesus macaques received tenofovir/emtricitabine with raltegravir intensification. Viral rebound occurred during treatment and sequencing of reverse transcriptase and integrase genes identified multiple resistance mutations. Similar to HIV infection, antiretroviral-resistance mutations may occur in SIV-infected nonhuman primates receiving nonsuppressive ART. As ART administration to nonhuman primates is currently dramatically expanding, fueled by both cure research and the study of HIV-related comorbidities, viral resistance should be factored in the study design and data interpretation.
