HIV-1 integrase strand-transfer inhibitor resistance in southern Taiwan.
The use of antiretroviral therapy has reduced rates of mortality and morbidity in patients with human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immune deficiency syndrome(HIV/AIDS). However, transmission of drug-resistant strains poses a challenge to control the spread of HIV-1. Primary resistance to integrase strand-transfer inhibitors (INSTIs) is rare despite their increased use. The prevalence of transmitted drug resistance (TDR) to INSTIs was 0.9% in northern Taiwan. This study was to analyse the prevalence and risk factors of TDR to INSTIs in southern Taiwan. In this study, we enrolled antiretroviral treatment-na√Øve HIV-1-infected subjects who underwent voluntary counselling and testing from 2013 to 2016 in southern Taiwan. Genotypic drug resistance, coreceptor tropism (CRT) and INSTI resistance were determined. Logistic regression was used to analyse the risk factors for INSTI polymorphic substitution. Sequences were obtained from 184 consecutive individuals, of whom 96.7% were men who have sex with men and 3.3% were heterosexual. Of the patients, 10% (19/183) had hepatitis B and 33.3% (61/183) had syphilis infection. Subtype B HIV-1 strains were found in 96.1% of the patients. Fifteen patients (8.4%, 15/178) harboured nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors or protease inhibitors resistance. CCR-5 coreceptors were used by 71.4% (130/184) of the patients. None of the patients had INSTI resistance-associated mutations, however 16 patients had INSTI polymorphic substitutions, and they were associated with a higher HIV viral load (
