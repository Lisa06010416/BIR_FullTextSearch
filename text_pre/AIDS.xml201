Non-coding RNAs and retroviruses.
Retroviruses can cause severe diseases such as cancer and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. A unique feature in the life cycle of retroviruses is that their RNA genome is reverse transcribed into double-stranded DNA, which then integrates into the host genome to exploit the host machinery for their benefits. The metazoan genome encodes numerous non-coding RNAs (ncRNA), which act as key regulators in essential cellular processes such as antiviral response. The development of next-generation sequencing technology has greatly accelerated the detection of ncRNAs from viruses and their hosts. ncRNAs have been shown to play important roles in the retroviral life cycle and virus-host interactions. Here, we review recent advances in ncRNA studies with special focus on those have changed our understanding of retroviruses or provided novel strategies to treat retrovirus-related diseases. Many ncRNAs such as microRNAs (miRNAs) and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are involved in the late phase of the retroviral life cycle. However, their roles in the early phase of viral replication merit further investigations.
