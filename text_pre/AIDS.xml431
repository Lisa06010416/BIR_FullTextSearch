How do skeletons with HIV present? A study on the identified CAL Milano Cemetery Skeletal Collection.
With the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection and Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) pandemic, the study of HIV/AIDS on bones has become of pivotal interest for research in bone pathologies, forensic applications (especially in the matter of identification when confronted to antemortem data) and medical purposes. In this paper, we document and discuss the macroscopic lesions found on the skeletons of nine individuals with known HIV, including four with known AIDS, coming from the identified CAL Milano Cemetery Skeletal Collection. As a result, several types of lesions were observed on bones: periosteal new bone formation, dental lesions, thickening of the frontal diploÃ«, destructive localized porosity and evidence of trauma. None of the lesions reported can be directly linked to HIV because the virus does not directly affect bones in a macroscopic way. However, HIV/AIDS-induced infections and inflammations and HIV-related risk factors may leave bone markers. The differential diagnosis of each of the lesions noted in this research and its potential link to HIV or AIDS was discussed. Although it is not possible to diagnose HIV on bare bones, this was not the focus of this study. To our knowledge, no anthropological study has ever been performed on known HIV individuals. With this paper, we present for the first time skeletons with known HIV.
