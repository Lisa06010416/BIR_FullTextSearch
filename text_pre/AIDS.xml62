O  therapy has finally reached a level where the biological mechanisms of action have been understood, showing that they are in the domain of physiology, biochemistry, and pharmacology. Few clinical applications have been reviewed here as well as exemplifying that O  therapy is particularly useful in musculoskeletal disorders. In the therapeutic range, O  can be used as a more effective and safe substitute of standard medications.
