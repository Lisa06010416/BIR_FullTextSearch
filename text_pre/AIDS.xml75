Lower likelihood of cardiac procedures after acute coronary syndrome in patients with human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome.
Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is an increasing cause of morbidity and mortality in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected adults; however, this population may be less likely to receive interventions during hospitalization for acute coronary syndrome (ACS). The degree to which this disparity can be attributed to poorly controlled HIV infection is unknown.In this large cohort study, we used the National Inpatient Sample (NIS) to compare rates of cardiac procedures among patients with asymptomatic HIV-infection, symptomatic acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), and uninfected adults hospitalized with ACS from 2009 to 2012. Multivariable analysis was used to compare procedure rates by HIV status, with appropriate weighting to account for NIS sampling design including stratification and hospital clustering.The dataset included 1,091,759 ACS hospitalizations, 0.35% of which (n = 3783) were in HIV-infected patients. Patients with symptomatic AIDS, asymptomatic HIV, and uninfected patients differed by sex, race, and income status. Overall rates of cardiac catheterization and revascularization were 53.3% and 37.4%, respectively. In multivariable regression, we found that relative to uninfected patients, those with symptomatic AIDS were less likely to undergo catheterization (odds ratio [OR] 0.48, confidence interval [CI] 0.43-0.55), percutaneous coronary intervention (OR 0.69, CI 0.59-0.79), and coronary artery bypass grafting (0.75, CI 0.61-0.93). No difference was seen for those with asymptomatic HIV relative to uninfected patients (OR 0.93, CI 0.81-1.07; OR 1.06, CI 0.93-1.21; OR 0.88, CI 0.72-1.06, respectively).We found that lower rates of cardiovascular procedures in HIV-infected patients were primarily driven by less frequent procedures in those with AIDS.
