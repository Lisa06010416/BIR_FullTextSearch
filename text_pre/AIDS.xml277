High-Resolution Sequencing of Viral Populations during Early Simian Immunodeficiency Virus Infection Reveals Evolutionary Strategies for Rapid Escape from Emerging Env-Specific Antibody Responses.
Primate lentiviruses, including the human and simian immunodeficiency viruses (HIV and SIV), produce infections marked by persistent, ongoing viral replication. This occurs despite the presence of virus-specific adaptive immune responses, including antibodies targeting the viral envelope glycoprotein (Env), and evolution of antibody-escape variants is a well-documented feature of lentiviral infection. Here, we examined the evolutionary dynamics of the SIV
