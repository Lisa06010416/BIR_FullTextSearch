Is early HIV infection diagnosis at a reference center a reality in the state of Ceara?
Early diagnosis of human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) can decrease transmission and significantly affect morbidity and mortality; however, Brazil still confronts the reality of late HIV diagnosis.Medical records of 284 HIV-positive patients were reviewed in this cross-sectional study.Of all patients, 28% were diagnosed in the context of health assessments, whereas 27% were symptomatic at diagnosis. Early HIV infection (Group 1) was diagnosed in 60.2% of participants. They were younger than those with late diagnosis (Group 2) (p = 0.002).These findings highlight the need for strategies to increase HIV testing in asymptomatic individuals and older patients.
