Prediction of HIV-1 and HIV-2 proteins by using Chou's pseudo amino acid compositions and different classifiers.
Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is the retroviral agent that causes acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). The number of HIV caused deaths was about 4 million in 2016 alone; it was estimated that about 33 million to 46 million people worldwide living with HIV. The HIV disease is especially harmful because the progressive destruction of the immune system prevents the ability of forming specific antibodies and to maintain an efficacious killer T cell activity. Successful prediction of HIV protein has important significance for the biological and pharmacological functions. In this study, based on the concept of Chou's pseudo amino acid (PseAA) composition and increment of diversity (ID), support vector machine (SVM), logisitic regression (LR), and multilayer perceptron (MP) were presented to predict HIV-1 proteins and HIV-2 proteins. The results of the jackknife test indicated that the highest prediction accuracy and CC values were obtained by the SVM and MP were 0.9909 and 0.9763, respectively, indicating that the classifiers presented in this study were suitable for predicting two groups of HIV proteins.
