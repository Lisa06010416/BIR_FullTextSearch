[Moxibustion combined with highly active antiretroviral therapy for CD   and Î³ chain cytokines of HIV infected patients].
To compare the effects of moxibustion combined with highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) and simple HAART for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infected patients.A total of 100 patients with HIV receiving HAART were randomized into an observation group and a control group, 50 cases in each one. In the observation group, moxibustion was used at Zusanli (ST 36), Guanyuan (CV 4) and Sanyinjiao (SP 6), etc. combined with HAART of zidovudine, lamivudine, nevirapine and efavirenzone, etc. Simple HAART was used in the control group. The patients were observed for 18 months. The indexes were CD  , CD  /CD  , interleukin 2 (IL-2), interleukin 7 (IL-7), the incidence of side effects and the score of quality of life.After treatment, CD  , CD  /CD  , serum IL-2 and the scores of quality of life (physiological, psychological, social relation fields and comprehensive score) increased and serum IL-7 decreased compared with those before treatment in the two groups (Moxibustion combined with HAART for HIV infected patients could reduce the incidence of side effects, improve medication compliance, CD  /CD  , IL-2, IL-7 and the quality of life.
