Integration of Neuropsychological Services in a VA HIV Primary Care Clinic.
The Department of Veteran Affairs (VA) is the largest health care provider for individuals with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), with >28,000 Veterans with HIV/AIDS enrolled in care. Advances in medical treatment have improved the life-limiting effects of the disease, though many chronic symptoms persist. Comprehensive care is critical to manage the diverse constellation of symptoms. However, many patients face challenges to receiving optimal care due to limited resources, mistrust of health care providers, and/or co-occurring medical, psychiatric, and substance use disorders. The VA is a leader in developing integrated models of care to address these barriers. The inclusion of subspecialty mental health and substance abuse treatment in HIV care has been implemented across many VAs, with evidence of improved patient outcomes. However, neuropsychology has not traditionally been included, despite the fact that cognitive dysfunction represents one of the most ubiquitous complications of HIV/AIDS. Cognitive impairment is associated with myriad negative outcomes including medication non-adherence, reduced quality of life, and increased mortality. We contend that neuropsychologists are uniquely equipped to contribute to the comprehensive care of patients with HIV/AIDS. Neuropsychologists understand the range of factors that can impact cognition and have the requisite knowledge and skills to assess and treat cognitive dysfunction. Although we focus on HIV/AIDS, neuropsychologists often play critical roles in the provision of care for other infectious diseases (e.g., hepatitis C).
