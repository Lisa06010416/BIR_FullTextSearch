Two-stage orthogonality based estimation for semiparametric varying-coefficient models and its applications in analyzing AIDS data.
Semiparametric smoothing methods are usually used to model longitudinal data, and the interest is to improve efficiency for regression coefficients. This paper is concerned with the estimation in semiparametric varying-coefficient models (SVCMs) for longitudinal data. By the orthogonal projection method, local linear technique, quasi-score estimation, and quasi-maximum likelihood estimation, we propose a two-stage orthogonality-based method to estimate parameter vector, coefficient function vector, and covariance function. The developed procedures can be implemented separately and the resulting estimators do not affect each other. Under some mild conditions, asymptotic properties of the resulting estimators are established explicitly. In particular, the asymptotic behavior of the estimator of coefficient function vector at the boundaries is examined. Further, the finite sample performance of the proposed procedures is assessed by Monte Carlo simulation experiments. Finally, the proposed methodology is illustrated with an analysis of an acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) dataset.
