Clinical features vary by the aetiology of meningitis in HIV seropositive patients: A four-year study from a tertiary hospital in India.
Meningitis is a serious infection of the nervous system associated with high mortality in Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) seropositive individuals. Asian clinical studies describing meningitis in people living with HIV are scarce. We describe the clinical features of meningitis in 116 HIV seropositive patients from a tertiary hospital in India as a cross-sectional observational study. The mean age of the patients in our study was 35Â±9 years with 70.6% of them being men. Eighty-five percent of the patients had an altered sensorium during the illness. Tuberculous meningitis [82.6%] was the most common cause. Clinical features varied by aetiology. Cranial nerve deficits [40%] were common in Cryptococcal meningitis. Hydrocephalus [3%], infarcts [15.9%] and IntraCranial Space Occupying Lesions (ICSOLs) [39.1%] were common in tuberculous meningitis.
