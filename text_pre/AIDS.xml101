Consecutive hypoglycemia attacks induced by co-trimoxazole followed by pentamidine in a patient with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome.
Both co-trimoxazole and pentamidine are used for the treatment of pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) and are known to cause hypoglycemia as an adverse drug reaction. Here, we describe a rare case of a late-diagnosed female patient with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) who developed the first hypoglycemic attack as an adverse effect of co-trimoxazole, followed by a second hypoglycemic attack as an adverse effect of pentamidine. Physicians caring for patients with AIDS and PCP should be aware of possible hypoglycemia in patients with many risk factors.
